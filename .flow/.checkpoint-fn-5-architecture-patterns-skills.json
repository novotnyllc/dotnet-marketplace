    "spec": "# fn-5: Architecture Patterns Skills\n\n## Overview\nDelivers practical modern architecture patterns including minimal API organization, background services, resilience (Polly v8), HTTP client best practices, observability, EF Core data access, and container deployment. These are **architecture-focused** skills that teach patterns and best practices. DI/async patterns live in fn-3; project scaffolding in fn-4; deep CI/CD in fn-19; deep testing in fn-7.\n\n## Scope\n**Skills (10 total):**\n- `dotnet-architecture-patterns` \u2014 Practical, modern patterns: minimal API organization at scale, vertical slices, request pipeline, error handling, validation, caching strategy, idempotency/outbox guidance\n- `dotnet-background-services` \u2014 BackgroundService, IHostedService, System.Threading.Channels for producer/consumer, graceful shutdown\n- `dotnet-resilience` \u2014 Polly v8 + Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience + Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience (the modern stack; supersedes Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly)\n- `dotnet-http-client` \u2014 IHttpClientFactory + resilience pipelines: typed clients, named clients, DelegatingHandlers, testing\n- `dotnet-observability` \u2014 OpenTelemetry (traces, metrics, logs), Serilog/MS.Extensions.Logging structured logging, health checks, custom metrics\n- `dotnet-efcore-patterns` \u2014 EF Core tactical patterns: DbContext lifecycle, AsNoTracking by default, query splitting, migrations, interceptors\n- `dotnet-efcore-architecture` \u2014 EF Core strategic patterns: separate read/write models, aggregate boundaries, repository policy, N+1 governance, row limits\n- `dotnet-data-access-strategy` \u2014 Choosing data access approach: EF Core vs Dapper vs raw ADO.NET, performance tradeoffs, AOT compatibility\n- `dotnet-containers` \u2014 Container best practices: multi-stage Dockerfiles, `dotnet publish` container images (.NET 8+), rootless, health checks\n- `dotnet-container-deployment` \u2014 Deploying .NET containers: Kubernetes basics (Deployment + Service + probe YAML), Docker Compose for local dev, CI/CD integration\n\n**Naming convention:** All skills use `dotnet-` prefix. Noun style for reference skills.\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n\n| Concern | fn-5 owns (architecture patterns) | Other epic owns (depth) | Enforcement |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| DI / async | Cross-references `[skill:dotnet-csharp-async-patterns]`, `[skill:dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection]` | fn-3: owns DI and async patterns | Each skill must contain cross-ref; grep validates |\n| Project scaffolding | Cross-references `[skill:dotnet-scaffold-project]` | fn-4: owns scaffolding skills | Grep validates cross-ref presence |\n| CI/CD | Container CI integration only | fn-19: composable workflows, matrix builds, deploy pipelines | Container skills must state \"advanced CI patterns \u2192 fn-19\" |\n| Testing | Deferred cross-refs to fn-7 skills (`dotnet-integration-testing`, `dotnet-snapshot-testing`) \u2014 added when fn-7 lands | fn-7: owns testing strategies and frameworks | Placeholder comments in EF Core/observability skills; fn-7 reconciliation task replaces placeholders with canonical IDs |\n| Version upgrades | N/A | fn-10: migration paths, polyfill strategies, multi-targeting | N/A |\n\n## Task Decomposition\n\n### fn-5.1: Architecture patterns and background services skills (parallelizable)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-architecture-patterns`, `dotnet-background-services`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-architecture-patterns/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-background-services/SKILL.md`\n- Both require `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- Does NOT touch `plugin.json` (handled by fn-5.6)\n\n### fn-5.2: Resilience and HTTP client skills (parallelizable)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-resilience`, `dotnet-http-client`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-resilience/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-http-client/SKILL.md`\n- Does NOT touch `plugin.json` (handled by fn-5.6)\n\n### fn-5.3: Observability skill (parallelizable)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-observability`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-observability/SKILL.md`\n- Does NOT touch `plugin.json` (handled by fn-5.6)\n\n### fn-5.4: Data access skills (parallelizable)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-efcore-patterns`, `dotnet-efcore-architecture`, `dotnet-data-access-strategy`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-efcore-patterns/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-efcore-architecture/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-data-access-strategy/SKILL.md`\n- `dotnet-efcore-patterns` = tactical: DbContext, queries, migrations, interceptors\n- `dotnet-efcore-architecture` = strategic: read/write split, aggregate boundaries, repository policy, N+1 governance\n- `dotnet-data-access-strategy` provides clear decision framework for EF Core vs Dapper vs ADO.NET\n- Does NOT touch `plugin.json` (handled by fn-5.6)\n\n### fn-5.5: Container skills (parallelizable)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-containers`, `dotnet-container-deployment`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-containers/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/architecture/dotnet-container-deployment/SKILL.md`\n- `dotnet-containers` covers multi-stage Dockerfiles, dotnet publish images, rootless, health checks\n- `dotnet-container-deployment` covers Kubernetes Deployment + Service + probe YAML, Docker Compose, CI/CD integration\n- Cross-references `[skill:dotnet-observability]` for health check patterns\n- Does NOT touch `plugin.json` (handled by fn-5.6)\n\n### fn-5.6: Integration \u2014 plugin registration, validation, and cross-reference audit (depends on fn-5.1\u2013fn-5.5)\n**Delivers:** Plugin registration and validation for all 10 skills\n- Registers all 10 skill paths in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n- Runs repo-wide AND catalog-level uniqueness check on skill `name` frontmatter (validates against existing `skills/*/*/SKILL.md` names and marketplace naming conventions)\n- Runs `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`\n- Validates boundary cross-references are present in each skill\n- Validates \"out-of-scope\" statements for fn-3 (DI/async), fn-4 (scaffolding), fn-7 (testing), fn-19 (CI/CD)\n- Verifies deferred fn-7 testing cross-ref placeholders are present\n- Single owner of `plugin.json` \u2014 eliminates merge conflicts\n\n**fn-7 Reconciliation:** When fn-7 lands, a follow-up task must replace deferred placeholder comments with canonical `[skill:...]` cross-references and validate via grep. This reconciliation is tracked as a dependency note in fn-7's spec.\n\n## Key Context\n- ASP.NET Core Best Practices: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/best-practices?view=aspnetcore-10.0\n- Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly is superseded by Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience ([migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/resilience/migration-guide)) \u2014 do not use for new projects\n- Polly v8.6.5 is the definitive standard (standard pipeline: rate limiter -> total timeout -> retry -> circuit breaker -> attempt timeout)\n- Vertical slice architecture is increasingly mainstream\n- OpenTelemetry is the standard observability approach in .NET 10\n\n## Quick Commands\n```bash\n# Validate all 10 skills exist with frontmatter\nfor s in dotnet-architecture-patterns dotnet-background-services dotnet-resilience dotnet-http-client dotnet-observability dotnet-efcore-patterns dotnet-efcore-architecture dotnet-data-access-strategy dotnet-containers dotnet-container-deployment; do\n  test -f \"skills/architecture/$s/SKILL.md\" && echo \"OK: $s\" || echo \"MISSING: $s\"\ndone\n\n# Validate frontmatter has required fields (name AND description)\nfor s in skills/architecture/*/SKILL.md; do\n  grep -q \"^name:\" \"$s\" && grep -q \"^description:\" \"$s\" && echo \"OK: $s\" || echo \"MISSING FRONTMATTER: $s\"\ndone\n\n# Repo-wide skill name uniqueness check (all skills across all categories)\ngrep -rh \"^name:\" skills/*/*/SKILL.md | sort | uniq -d  # expect empty (no duplicates)\n\n# Canonical frontmatter validation (single command)\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n\n# Verify resilience skill mentions superseded packages\ngrep -i \"supersed\\|migration\" skills/architecture/dotnet-resilience/SKILL.md\n\n# Verify cross-references use canonical fn-3 IDs\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-csharp-async-patterns\\]\" skills/architecture/\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection\\]\" skills/architecture/\n\n# Verify boundary cross-references\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-resilience\\]\" skills/architecture/dotnet-http-client/SKILL.md\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-observability\\]\" skills/architecture/dotnet-container-deployment/SKILL.md\n\n# Verify out-of-scope statements\ngrep -l \"fn-3\\|DI patterns\\|async patterns\" skills/architecture/*/SKILL.md | wc -l  # expect >= 2\ngrep -l \"fn-7\\|testing patterns\" skills/architecture/*/SKILL.md | wc -l  # expect >= 2\n\n# Verify deferred fn-7 placeholders exist\ngrep -rl \"TODO.*fn-7\\|placeholder.*fn-7\\|deferred.*fn-7\" skills/architecture/*/SKILL.md | wc -l  # expect >= 3\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. All 10 skills exist at `skills/architecture/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter\n2. Architecture patterns skill covers vertical slices, minimal API organization at scale, caching strategy, idempotency/outbox guidance\n3. Background services skill documents Channels-based producer/consumer patterns, hosted service lifecycle, and graceful shutdown\n4. Resilience skill recommends Polly v8 + MS.Extensions.Http.Resilience, explicitly notes Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly is superseded\n5. HTTP client skill integrates resilience pipelines with typed/named clients, cross-references `[skill:dotnet-resilience]`\n6. Observability skill covers OpenTelemetry setup for traces/metrics/logs plus structured logging\n7. EF Core patterns skill covers DbContext lifecycle, AsNoTracking, migrations, query splitting, interceptors (tactical)\n8. EF Core architecture skill covers read/write split, aggregate boundaries, repository policy, N+1 governance (strategic)\n9. Data access strategy skill provides clear decision framework for EF Core vs Dapper vs ADO.NET with AOT compatibility notes\n10. Container skills cover multi-stage Dockerfiles, dotnet publish images, health checks, and Kubernetes Deployment + Service + probe YAML\n11. Skills cross-reference fn-3 skills using canonical IDs (`dotnet-csharp-async-patterns`, `dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection`) \u2014 not re-teach\n12. Each skill contains explicit out-of-scope boundary statements for related epics (fn-3 DI/async, fn-4 scaffolding, fn-7 testing, fn-19 CI/CD) where applicable\n13. All 10 skills registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (single integration task fn-5.6)\n14. `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes for all 10 skills\n15. Skill `name` frontmatter values are unique repo-wide (no duplicates across all `skills/*/*/SKILL.md`)\n16. Testing cross-refs to fn-7 skills are deferred (placeholder comments, non-blocking) with reconciliation tracked\n17. Tasks fn-5.1\u2013fn-5.5 are fully parallelizable (file-disjoint, no shared file edits)\n\n## Test Notes\n- Verify resilience skill detects and warns about superseded Polly packages\n- Test that HTTP client skill cross-references resilience for pipeline configuration\n- Validate observability skill recommends OpenTelemetry over legacy approaches\n- Verify container deployment skill includes Kubernetes Deployment + Service + probe YAML examples\n- Run `grep -rh \"^name:\" skills/*/*/SKILL.md | sort | uniq -d` to confirm no duplicate names repo-wide\n- Verify boundary cross-references use canonical fn-3 IDs (not shorthand)\n- Verify out-of-scope boundary statements are present where applicable\n- Verify deferred fn-7 placeholder comments exist in EF Core and observability skills\n- Verify `plugin.json` contains all 10 architecture skill paths after fn-5.6\n\n## References\n- ASP.NET Core Best Practices: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/best-practices?view=aspnetcore-10.0\n- Polly v8 documentation: https://www.pollydocs.org/\n- OpenTelemetry .NET: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net/\n- David Fowler Async Guidance: https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md\n- EF Core Best Practices: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/performance/\n- .NET Container Images: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/build-container\n"
