# Skill Front Matter Compliance Audit Report

**Task:** fn-49-skill-guide-compliance-review.1
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Skills audited:** 127 (126 active + 1 disabled via `disable-model-invocation`)
**Current budget:** 12,417 chars (active skills only)
**WARN threshold:** 12,000 chars | **FAIL threshold:** 15,000 chars

## Quality Rubric

| # | Dimension | Check | Severity | Result |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Budget compliance | Description <=120 chars | Critical | PASS -- 0 violations (max 109 chars) |
| 2 | Name-directory match | `name` field matches directory path | Critical | PASS -- 0 mismatches across 127 skills |
| 3 | Extra frontmatter fields | Only `name` and `description` present | Major | PASS -- only `plugin-self-publish` has `disable-model-invocation` (legitimate) |
| 4 | Trigger specificity | Description contains technology + action trigger | Major | PASS -- all 127 have identifiable technology and action terms |
| 5 | Keyword density | No filler words | Major | 1 finding -- `dotnet-csharp-async-patterns` uses "Covers" (filler verb) |
| 6 | Disambiguation | Description distinct from sibling skills | Major | 7 overlapping pairs identified (see below) |
| 7 | Third-person voice | No first/second person pronouns | Minor | PASS -- 0 violations (I/O abbreviations are not pronouns) |
| 8 | WHEN prefix evaluation | Does WHEN add routing value? | Minor | 127/127 use WHEN -- systemic; removing saves 635 chars |

| Field | `dotnet-cli-distribution` | `dotnet-cli-packaging` |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|

### M-4. Disambiguation: `dotnet-csharp-code-smells` vs `dotnet-csharp-coding-standards`

| Field | `dotnet-csharp-code-smells` | `dotnet-csharp-coding-standards` |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|

| Suggested desc (surface) | WHEN detecting API changes in CI. PublicApiAnalyzers, Verify snapshots, breaking change enforcement. (100 chars) |

## Minor Findings

### m-1. WHEN Prefix Overhead (Systemic)

**All 127 skills** use the `WHEN` prefix pattern. Each `WHEN ` costs 5 characters.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Skills using WHEN | 127/127 (100%) |
| Chars consumed by WHEN | 635 chars (127 x 5) |
| Current budget | 12,417 chars |
| Budget after WHEN removal | 11,782 chars |
| Would cross below WARN? | Yes (11,782 < 12,000) |

**Analysis:** The WHEN prefix was originally intended to help Claude understand activation context, per the description formula in CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md ("WHEN writing, reviewing, or planning C# code"). However:

1. Claude's language understanding already extracts activation context from the rest of the description
2. The WHEN prefix is uniform -- every skill has it, so it provides zero disambiguation signal
3. Removing WHEN from all 127 skills saves 635 chars, bringing the budget from 12,417 to 11,782 (below WARN threshold)
4. The second sentence already contains specific triggers (technology names, action verbs)

**Recommendation:** Remove the WHEN prefix from all descriptions. This is the single most impactful budget optimization available. It brings the budget below WARN with 218 chars of headroom. Existing trigger words in the second sentence (technology + action) provide equivalent routing signal.

**Example transformations:**
- Before: `WHEN writing async/await code. Task patterns, ConfigureAwait, cancellation, agent pitfalls.`
- After: `Async/await patterns. Task patterns, ConfigureAwait, cancellation, agent pitfalls.`
- Or: `Writing async/await code. Task patterns, ConfigureAwait, cancellation, agent pitfalls.`

## Budget Impact Estimate

| Optimization | Chars saved | New total |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Baseline (current) | -- | 12,417 |
| Remove all WHEN prefixes | -635 | 11,782 |
| Fix M-8 (remove "Covers") | -7 | 11,775 |
| Disambiguation fixes (M-1 through M-7, M-9) | ~-50 (net from rewording) | ~11,725 |
| **Projected total after all fixes** | **~-692** | **~11,725** |

**Target:** <=11,800 chars (epic acceptance criterion)
**Projected result:** ~11,725 chars -- meets target with ~75 chars headroom

## Recommendations for Task 2

### Priority 1: Remove WHEN prefix (systemic, -635 chars)
Remove `WHEN ` from all 127 descriptions. Capitalize the new first word. This single change brings the budget below WARN.

### Priority 2: Fix 8 disambiguation pairs (8 skills affected)
Apply the suggested description rewording from findings M-1 through M-7 and M-9. Net savings ~50 chars from shorter rewording.

### Priority 3: Remove filler word (1 skill affected)
Fix M-8: remove "Covers" from `dotnet-csharp-async-patterns`.

### Total projected budget after all fixes: ~11,725 chars (below 11,800 target)
