full SKILL.md on invoke\n- **MCP Tool Search**: Auto-activates when >10% context consumed (96% reduction)\n- **Validate in fn-2**: First task must prototype router skill and verify budget math\n\n### Hook Performance Strategy (resolves gap: <5s vs dotnet format)\n- `dotnet format` runs in **background** with results reported on next interaction\n- `dotnet restore` runs **async** after .csproj edits\n- Only **fast validation** (<1s) runs synchronously (XAML syntax, frontmatter check)\n- Configurable aggressiveness: low (nothing sync), moderate (fast checks), aggressive (all sync)\n\n### Version Detection Strategy (resolves gap: multi-targeting, caching)\n- Detection runs **on first .NET file encounter** per session\n- Caches per-project (keyed by solution/project path)\n- Multi-targeting: **highest TFM** drives guidance, with polyfill callouts for lower TFMs\n- Inconsistent files: **warn agent**, use most specific (.csproj TFM over global.json)\n\n### Cross-Agent Feature Matrix (resolves gap: feature parity)\n| Feature                | Claude Code     | Copilot             | Codex                   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| Skills                 | Full SKILL.md   | .github/skills/     | AGENTS.md sections      |\n| Agents                 | Full subagents  | N/A (no equivalent) | Multi-agent worktrees   |\n| Hooks                  | Full hooks.json | N/A                 | N/A                     |\n| MCP                    | .mcp.json       | VS Code MCP         | N/A                     |\n| Progressive disclosure | Native          | Via applyTo         | Via directory hierarchy |\n\nSkills degrade gracefully: Claude-specific features (hooks, MCP, agents) are omitted from Copilot/Codex formats. Core skill guidance is identical across all agents.\n\n## Execution Strategy\n- **Ralph loop swarm** executes Wave 0 first\n- On fn-2 completion, all Wave 1 epics unblock and execute in parallel\n- Wave 2-3 epics are detailed via **plan-sync** after Wave 1 implementation\n- RP review focuses on fn-2 and Wave 1 correctness\n\n## Quick commands\n```bash\n# List all dotnet-artisan epics\n.flow/bin/flowctl epics\n\n# Check what's ready to work on\n.flow/bin/flowctl ready --epic fn-2\n\n# Start foundation work\n.flow/bin/flowctl start fn-2.1\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] All 24 sub-epics created with proper dependency links\n- [ ] Wave 0 (fn-2) fully detailed with task specs\n- [ ] Wave 1 epics have task breakdowns\n- [ ] Wave 2-3 epics have titles and lightweight specs\n- [ ] RP review passes for Wave 0-1\n- [ ] Epic dependency graph matches Wave structure\n"
