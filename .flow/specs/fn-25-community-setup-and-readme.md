# fn-25: Community Setup and README

## Problem/Goal
Create comprehensive community setup including README.md with skill catalog and architecture diagrams, CONTRIBUTING.md with skill authoring guide, CHANGELOG.md, and updated CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md with plugin-specific instructions.

## Acceptance Checks
- [ ] README.md created with skill catalog, installation, usage examples, Mermaid architecture diagrams, acknowledgements
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md created with skill authoring guide, PR process, validation requirements
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created with initial release notes
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with dotnet-artisan plugin-specific instructions
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated with skill index and agent delegation patterns
- [ ] All documentation references the Agent Skills open standard
- [ ] Cross-references to documentation skills, build pipeline

## Dependencies
- fn-20 (Packaging & Publishing) — README references installation/publishing
- fn-21 (Documentation Skills) — README references documentation tooling
- fn-24 (Cross-Agent Build Pipeline) — README documents cross-agent support, CONTRIBUTING references build pipeline

## Key Context
- README must be comprehensive but approachable
- Mermaid diagrams show plugin architecture, skill relationships, agent delegation
- CONTRIBUTING.md must enable high-quality community contributions
- Acknowledgements section credits dotnet-skills and other references
- Open but curated community model with automated validation
