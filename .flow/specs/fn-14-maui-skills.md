# fn-14: MAUI Skills

## Problem/Goal
Add MAUI development skills with honest assessment of current state, platform-specific patterns, and Native AOT support. Enable dotnet-maui-specialist agent to guide MAUI development including platform-specific issues and workarounds.

## Acceptance Checks
- [ ] `dotnet-maui-development` skill covers modern patterns with honest current-state assessment (VS 2026 issues, iOS gaps)
- [ ] `dotnet-maui-aot` skill covers Native AOT on iOS/Mac Catalyst (50% size/startup improvements, library compatibility)
- [ ] `dotnet-maui-specialist` agent configured with deep platform-specific expertise
- [ ] Cross-references to dotnet-ui-chooser, dotnet-native-aot, dotnet-maui-testing
- [ ] .NET 11 XAML source gen and CoreCLR for Android defaults documented

## Key Context
- Production-ready with caveats (36% YoY growth, 557% community PR increase)
- .NET 11 Preview 1: XAML source gen default, CoreCLR for Android default
- Native AOT: 50% size/startup improvement, library compatibility gaps
- Skills must present migration options (WinUI for Windows-only, Uno for cross-platform)
