    "spec": "# fn-49 Skill Guide Compliance Review\n\n## Overview\n\nAudit all skills and agents against Anthropic's published \"Complete Guide to Building Skills for Claude\" (Jan 2026). Identify gaps in structure, content depth, progressive disclosure, and cross-referencing. Produce a remediation plan and fix non-compliant skills.\n\nThis is distinct from fn-29 (Fleet Skill Review, done) which was a quality sweep. This epic specifically targets compliance with the Anthropic skill guide's recommendations.\n\n## Scope\n\n**In:** Audit all 122+ skills against the Anthropic skill guide checklist. Audit all 14 agents. Fix structural/content issues found. Update validation scripts if new checks are needed.\n\n**Out:** Adding new skills (other epics handle that). Changing plugin architecture.\n\n**Scope boundary with fn-29**: fn-29 was a general quality review (done). This epic is a targeted compliance check against the published Anthropic guide, which was released after fn-29 completed.\n\n## Key Context\n\n- Guide: https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf\n- Key guide recommendations: progressive disclosure (metadata\u2192body\u2192references), 1500-2000 word body target (max 5000), clear trigger patterns, cross-references, structured sections\n- Existing validation (`validate-skills.sh`) checks frontmatter and naming but not content structure or depth\n- This is a review+fix epic, not just a report \u2014 remediations are implemented\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] Compliance audit checklist created from the Anthropic skill guide\n- [ ] All skills audited against checklist (batch by category)\n- [ ] Non-compliant skills fixed (structure, descriptions, cross-refs)\n- [ ] Agents audited for trigger patterns and preloaded skill lists\n- [ ] Validation scripts updated with any new structural checks\n- [ ] All validation scripts pass after fixes\n\n## References\n\n- https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf\n- `scripts/validate-skills.sh` (existing validation)\n- `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md` (current authoring guide)\n- fn-29 spec (prior fleet review, for context on what was already fixed)\n"
