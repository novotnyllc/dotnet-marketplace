    "spec": "# Expert Domain Agents and Luminary Attribution\n\n## Overview\nCreate domain-named specialist agents grounded in the expertise of prominent .NET luminaries (Stephen Toub, David Fowler, Damian Edwards, Steve Smith, Mads Torgersen, Andrew Lock, Jimmy Bogard, Stephen Cleary, Nick Chapsas). Add source attribution to existing skills and agents. All agents are named by domain, not by person \u2014 following Anthropic's usage policy and community best practices.\n\n**Key principle:** Capture expertise, not persona. Agents are \"grounded in guidance from\" \u2014 they do not claim to represent or speak for any individual.\n\n## Scope\n\n### New Agents (5 total)\n1. **dotnet-async-performance-specialist** \u2014 Deep async/await and runtime performance analysis. Grounded in Stephen Toub's .NET performance blog series, ConfigureAwait FAQ, and async internals guidance. Covers: ValueTask correctness, ConfigureAwait decisions, async overhead detection, ThreadPool tuning, IO.Pipelines patterns, Channel selection.\n2. **dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist** \u2014 ASP.NET Core architecture, middleware, and backend patterns. Grounded in David Fowler's AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios and Andrew Lock's middleware blog series. Covers: middleware authoring, DI anti-patterns, minimal API design, request pipeline optimization, diagnostic scenarios.\n3. **dotnet-testing-specialist** \u2014 Test architecture and strategy. Covers: test pyramid design, E2E architecture, test data management, microservice testing, when to use integration vs unit vs E2E.\n4. **dotnet-cloud-specialist** \u2014 Cloud deployment and .NET Aspire orchestration. Covers: AKS/Azure deployment, GitHub Actions pipelines, Aspire service discovery, distributed tracing, infrastructure-as-code.\n5. **dotnet-code-review-agent** \u2014 General code review combining performance, security, architecture, and correctness. Routes to specialist agents for deep dives.\n\n### Existing Agent Enrichment\n- **dotnet-blazor-specialist** \u2190 Damian Edwards (Razor/Blazor component design patterns)\n- **dotnet-architect** \u2190 Steve Smith/Ardalis (Clean Architecture, SOLID decision framework)\n- **dotnet-csharp-coding-standards / dotnet-csharp-modern-patterns** skills \u2190 Mads Torgersen (C# language design rationale)\n- **dotnet-performance-analyst** \u2190 Stephen Cleary async patterns, Nick Chapsas modern .NET patterns\n- Architecture/domain skills \u2190 Jimmy Bogard (DDD, vertical slices; note MediatR is commercial)\n\n### Luminary Attribution on Skills\nAdd \"Knowledge Sources\" or \"References\" sections to 6+ existing skills citing authoritative luminary sources.\n\n### Routing Updates\n- Update `dotnet-advisor` catalog to route to all new agents\n- Update `AGENTS.md` delegation table with new agent triggers and boundaries\n\n## Design Constraints\n- Agent names are domain-based, NEVER person-based\n- Each agent includes a \"Knowledge Sources\" section listing luminaries as sources, with disclaimer\n- Agent descriptions include \"grounded in [source]\" language\n- Agents use read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash) \u2014 analysis only\n- Each agent < 3,000 tokens for composability\n- Follow frontmatter pattern from `agents/dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist.md`\n- Budget impact: 0 chars for agents (agents are separate from skill description budget)\n\n## Quick commands\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\npython3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict\npython3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] 5 new domain-named agents created (async-performance, aspnetcore, testing, cloud, code-review)\n- [ ] All new agents follow frontmatter pattern with Knowledge Sources and disclaimer\n- [ ] 4+ existing agents enriched with luminary-sourced knowledge\n- [ ] 7 luminaries covered: Toub, Fowler, Edwards, Smith, Torgersen, Lock, Cleary (plus Bogard, Chapsas via attribution)\n- [ ] Attribution references added to 6+ existing skills\n- [ ] dotnet-advisor catalog updated with all new agent routing\n- [ ] AGENTS.md updated with all new agent entries\n- [ ] No agent named after a person\n- [ ] All agents under 3,000 tokens\n- [ ] All four validation commands pass\n- [ ] No fn-N spec references in any content\n\n## References\n- `agents/dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist.md` \u2014 template for agent frontmatter and structure\n- `agents/dotnet-performance-analyst.md` \u2014 template for analysis agent workflow\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md:69-104` \u2014 agent authoring conventions\n- `AGENTS.md:32-64` \u2014 agent delegation table\n- Stephen Toub's .NET Performance Blog: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/author/toub/\n- Stephen Toub's ConfigureAwait FAQ: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/configureawait-faq/\n- David Fowler's AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios: https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios\n- Andrew Lock's blog: https://andrewlock.net/\n- Steve Smith/Ardalis Clean Architecture: https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture\n- Anthropic Usage Policy (impersonation prohibition): https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup\n"

Covers test pyramid design, E2E test architecture, test data management, microservice testing strategies, when to use integration vs unit vs E2E. Preloads: `dotnet-testing-strategy`, `dotnet-xunit`, `dotnet-integration-testing`, `dotnet-snapshot-testing`, `dotnet-playwright`.\n2. **dotnet-cloud-specialist** \u2014 Cloud deployment and .NET Aspire orchestration agent. Covers AKS/Azure deployment, GitHub Actions multi-stage pipelines, Aspire service discovery, distributed tracing, infrastructure-as-code for .NET apps. Preloads: `dotnet-containers`, `dotnet-container-deployment`, `dotnet-observability`, `dotnet-ado-patterns`.\n3. **dotnet-code-review-agent** \u2014 General code review agent combining performance, security, architecture, and correctness review. Routes to specialist agents for deep dives. Preloads: a broad set of core skills. Triggers on: \"review this\", \"code review\", \"PR review\", \"what's wrong with this code\".\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** `agents/dotnet-testing-specialist.md`, `agents/dotnet-cloud-specialist.md`, `agents/dotnet-code-review-agent.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n\n## Approach\n- Follow agent frontmatter pattern from `agents/dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist.md`\n- All agents domain-named, NOT person-named\n- Each agent < 3,000 tokens, with focused scope and explicit boundaries\n- Include \"Does NOT\" boundary sections to prevent overlap with existing agents\n- Testing specialist: does NOT handle performance benchmarking (use benchmark-designer), does NOT handle security auditing (use security-reviewer)\n- Cloud specialist: does NOT handle general architecture (use architect), does NOT handle container image optimization (covered in container skills)\n- Code review agent: triages and routes to specialists, does NOT replace specialized reviewers for deep domain analysis\n- Register all in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` agents array\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] dotnet-testing-specialist agent created with frontmatter and decision tree\n- [ ] dotnet-cloud-specialist agent created with frontmatter and decision tree\n- [ ] dotnet-code-review-agent created with frontmatter and triage workflow\n- [ ] All 3 agents have explicit \"Does NOT\" boundary sections\n- [ ] All 3 agents under 3,000 tokens each\n- [ ] All 3 registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` agents array\n- [ ] No overlap with existing agents (concurrency, performance, security, Blazor, Uno, MAUI)\n- [ ] All four validation commands pass\n## Done summary\nCreated three specialist agents: dotnet-testing-specialist (test architecture and strategy), dotnet-cloud-specialist (.NET Aspire and cloud deployment), and dotnet-code-review-agent (multi-dimensional code review with triage routing). All agents include frontmatter, decision trees, explicit boundary sections, trigger lexicons, and are registered in plugin.json.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 0b43289dfd764fcd010a8ba138ccad0d6f5bf641\n- Tests: ./scripts/validate-skills.sh, ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh, python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict, python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py\n- PRs:"

Rather than creating new agents for every luminary, fold their expertise into the agents that already cover their domains.\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** `agents/dotnet-blazor-specialist.md`, `agents/dotnet-architect.md`, `agents/dotnet-performance-analyst.md`, `skills/core-csharp/dotnet-csharp-coding-standards/SKILL.md`, `skills/core-csharp/dotnet-csharp-modern-patterns/SKILL.md`\n\n## Approach\nLuminaries mapped to existing agents:\n- **Damian Edwards** (Razor/Blazor) \u2192 enrich `dotnet-blazor-specialist` with component design patterns, Blazor rendering guidance, Edwards' Razor patterns. Add Knowledge Sources section.\n- **Steve Smith / Ardalis** (Clean Architecture, SOLID) \u2192 enrich `dotnet-architect` with Clean Architecture guidance, SOLID decision framework. Add Knowledge Sources section.\n- **Mads Torgersen** (C# language design) \u2192 enrich `dotnet-csharp-coding-standards` and `dotnet-csharp-modern-patterns` skills with language design rationale references, NOT the concurrency specialist (Torgersen's expertise is language design broadly, not concurrency). C# Language Design Notes as source.\n- **Andrew Lock** (ASP.NET Core config, middleware) \u2192 aspnetcore-specialist already has Knowledge Sources section citing Lock's blog (added in fn-38.2). Enrich decision tree entries in aspnetcore-specialist with Lock's configuration/host-builder patterns and enrich relevant middleware skills (`dotnet-middleware-patterns` is already a preloaded skill). Do NOT duplicate the existing Knowledge Sources entry.\n<!-- Updated by plan-sync: fn-38.2 already added Andrew Lock Knowledge Sources to aspnetcore-specialist -->\n- **Nick Chapsas** (modern .NET patterns, clean code) \u2192 attribution in relevant skills, not a separate agent\n- **Jimmy Bogard** (MediatR, vertical slices, DDD patterns) \u2192 attribution in domain modeling and architecture skills. Note: MediatR is now commercial for commercial use.\n- **Stephen Cleary** (async best practices) \u2192 enrich async-performance-specialist and async-patterns skill with Cleary's \"Concurrency in C#\" guidance\n\nFor each enrichment:\n- Add \"Knowledge Sources\" section if not present\n- Add relevant decision tree entries grounded in luminary guidance\n- Do NOT rename agents or change their core scope\n- Do NOT impersonate \u2014 use \"grounded in guidance from\" pattern\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] dotnet-blazor-specialist enriched with Damian Edwards component design patterns\n- [ ] dotnet-architect enriched with Steve Smith/Ardalis Clean Architecture + SOLID guidance\n- [ ] Mads Torgersen C# language design rationale referenced in `dotnet-csharp-coding-standards` and/or `dotnet-csharp-modern-patterns` skills\n- [ ] Andrew Lock middleware/config guidance enriched in aspnetcore-specialist decision tree (Knowledge Sources entry already present from fn-38.2) and relevant middleware skills\n- [ ] Jimmy Bogard DDD/vertical slice guidance attributed in domain modeling content\n- [ ] Stephen Cleary async best practices referenced in async-related content\n- [ ] All enrichments use \"Knowledge Sources\" sections with proper attribution\n- [ ] No agents renamed or core scope changed\n- [ ] All four validation commands pass\n## Done summary\nEnriched 5 existing agents and 6 skills with luminary-sourced Knowledge Sources sections covering 9 luminaries (Edwards, Smith/Ardalis, Torgersen, Lock, Bogard, Cleary, Chapsas, Toub, Fowler). Added actionable decision tree entries to aspnetcore-specialist (Lock config/host-builder patterns) and Edwards-grounded component design patterns to blazor-specialist. All enrichments use \"grounded in guidance from\" attribution pattern with disclaimers; no agents renamed or core scope changed.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 42acfa4b5e6e9b8e20fc6e12e6dae8f5e29d23d5, 18b2f10a0ae8de6acb338c3a298ce49630d9fd51\n- Tests: ./scripts/validate-skills.sh, ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh, python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict, python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py\n- PRs:"
