    "spec": "# Consolidate 131 Skills into 8 Broad Skills\n\n## Overview\n\nThe plugin has 131 individual skills consuming 75% of the 15,600-char routing description budget. Research shows Tier 1 plugin repos converge on 5-16 skills (Vercel: 6, kepano/obsidian: 5, anthropics/skills: 16). RAG-MCP research shows routing accuracy drops from 43% to 13% with many tools. This epic consolidates 131 skills into 8 broad skills (6 content + debugging + advisor) with companion files for depth. With 8 skills, each description gets 400+ chars (vs 120 today) for dramatically better routing signal while using only ~20% of the budget.\n\n**The 8 skills:**\n\n| # | Skill | Source skills | What merges in |\n|---|-------|:---:|---|\n| 1 | **dotnet-csharp** | ~22 | Language patterns, async, DI, config, generators, standards, nullable types, serialization, channels, LINQ, domain modeling, SOLID, concurrency, analyzers, editorconfig, file I/O, native interop, validation |\n| 2 | **dotnet-api** | ~28 | ASP.NET Core, minimal APIs, middleware, EF Core, data access, gRPC, SignalR, resilience, HTTP client, API versioning, OpenAPI, security (OWASP, secrets, crypto), background services, Aspire, Semantic Kernel, architecture patterns |\n| 3 | **dotnet-ui** | ~18 | Blazor (patterns, components, auth, testing), MAUI (dev, AOT, testing), Uno (platform, targets, MCP, testing), WPF, WinUI, WinForms, accessibility, localization, UI chooser |\n| 4 | **dotnet-testing** | ~11 | Strategy, xUnit, integration, snapshot, Playwright, UI testing core, BenchmarkDotNet, test quality, CI benchmarking |\n| 5 | **dotnet-devops** | ~18 | CI/CD (GHA 4 + ADO 4), containers (2), NuGet, MSIX, GitHub Releases, release management, observability, structured logging |\n| 6 | **dotnet-tooling** | ~34 | Project setup, MSBuild, build, perf patterns, profiling, AOT/trimming, GC/memory, CLI apps, terminal UI, docs generation, tool management, version detection/upgrade, solution nav |\n| 7 | **dotnet-debugging** | 1 | Standalone (user requirement). WinDbg debugging (single source skill: `dotnet-windbg-debugging`) |\n| 8 | **dotnet-advisor** | 1 | Router/dispatcher (rewritten for 8 skills) |\n\nEach consolidated skill gets:\n- **SKILL.md** (auto-loaded on activation): overview, routing table, scope/out-of-scope, ToC pointing to companion files (~2-5KB)\n- **references/** directory: topic-named companion files with deep content from merged source skills (read on demand)\n\n## Execution model\n\n**Single PR, big-bang migration.** All tasks land in one PR. CI only needs to pass on the final combined diff \u2014 intermediate states (after tasks 2-6 delete source dirs but before task .9 updates plugin.json and task .10 updates CI gates) are not independently mergeable. This is required because CI count gates make partial states unmergeable.\n\nTasks 2-6 run in parallel within a single worktree/branch, creating new dirs and deleting old ones. Task .9 then updates the manifest, agents, and advisor atomically. Task .10 updates CI gates and docs last. The final commit(s) must pass all validators.\n\n## Scope\n\n- Consolidate all 131 skill directories into 8 new skill directories\n- Create companion `references/` files preserving all source skill content\n- Rewrite `dotnet-advisor` routing catalog for 8 skills (replace mandatory first-action \"dotnet-csharp-coding-standards\" with \"dotnet-csharp\")\n- Update all 14 agent preloaded skill references\n- Update hooks, CI gates, validators\n- Update validator thresholds: `--projected-skills 8`, `--max-desc-chars` raised to 600, warn/fail budget stays at 15,600\n- Update `.agents/openai.yaml` discovery metadata for 8 skills\n- Delete complex eval harness (`tests/evals/`) \u2014 structural validators only\n- Simplify copilot smoke tests for 8 skills\n- Update all documentation for new skill count and description policy\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Redirect stubs for old skill names (no external consumers)\n- New skill content (consolidation only, not enhancement)\n- Agent restructuring (agents stay as-is, just update references)\n- New eval framework (structural validators are sufficient)\n\n## Key decisions\n\n1. **8 skills, not ~20** \u2014 Tier 1 repos converge on 5-16 skills. With 8 skills at 400 chars each, routing signal per skill is 3x better than 20 skills at 120 chars. Companion files handle depth.\n2. **dotnet-advisor survives** \u2014 hooks inject it as mandatory first action; rewrite routing catalog for 8 skills. Replace \"invoke dotnet-csharp-coding-standards\" with \"invoke dotnet-csharp (read references/coding-standards.md)\".\n3. **Big-bang migration in a single PR** \u2014 CI count gates prevent incremental merging. All tasks land in one PR; CI passes only on final diff.\n4. **Framework testing \u2192 UI framework group** \u2014 `dotnet-blazor-testing` \u2192 `dotnet-ui`, etc.\n5. **Companion file convention** \u2014 `references/` directory (plural) with topic-named `.md` files. Rename existing `reference/` (singular) in dotnet-windbg-debugging.\n6. **SKILL.md includes explicit ToC** \u2014 directs model to read specific companion files on demand.\n7. **debugging stays standalone** \u2014 user requirement. Single source skill (`dotnet-windbg-debugging`).\n8. **Delete eval harness, keep structural validators** \u2014 8,100-line Python eval harness never ran in CI. Structural validators catch the top bug classes deterministically in <5 seconds. With 8 skills, routing confusion drops dramatically.\n9. **dotnet-tooling as intentional grab-bag** \u2014 at 34 source skills it's the broadest group. Companion files (`references/msbuild.md`, `references/native-aot.md`, `references/cli-apps.md`, etc.) organize the depth. If it proves too broad post-implementation, splitting into build/performance/cli is a single-task change.\n10. **plugin.json updated once in task .9** \u2014 tasks 2-6 only create new directories/files and delete old ones; they do NOT edit plugin.json. Task .9 updates plugin.json, agents, advisor, and hooks atomically to avoid merge conflicts.\n11. **Validator thresholds updated in task .10** \u2014 `--projected-skills 8`, per-skill description cap raised from 120 to 600 chars. Global budget stays at 15,600. Documentation updated to match.\n12. **Smoke test strategy: preserve case IDs, remap expected_skills** \u2014 existing `--case-id` filter in CI stays unchanged. Only `expected_skill` fields in `cases.jsonl` are remapped to new 8-skill names. Then optionally prune cases not referenced by CI.\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n# Validate after changes (only passes on final combined diff)\nSTRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] 8 consolidated skill directories replace 131 individual directories\n- [ ] All source skill content preserved in SKILL.md + references/ companion files\n- [ ] All 14 agents updated with correct [skill:new-name] references\n- [ ] dotnet-advisor rewritten for 8 skills (dramatically simpler routing catalog)\n- [ ] Hooks reference valid skill names\n- [ ] CI gates updated (EXPECTED=8, --projected-skills 8)\n- [ ] Validator per-skill description cap raised from 120 to 600 chars\n- [ ] `.agents/openai.yaml` updated for 8 skills\n- [ ] `tests/evals/` directory deleted (eval harness removed)\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh && validate-marketplace.sh` both pass (after threshold updates)\n- [ ] `validate-marketplace.sh` passes specifically after legacy directory deletion (manifest/filesystem consistency)\n- [ ] `reference/` (singular) renamed to `references/` (plural) everywhere; grep confirms no stale `/reference/` assumptions\n- [ ] Similarity baseline regenerated for 8 skills\n- [ ] Copilot smoke tests: existing case IDs preserved, `expected_skills` remapped to 8-skill names\n- [ ] Total description budget under 3,900 chars (~25% of 15,600 cap)\n- [ ] README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md updated with correct skill count and description policy\n- [ ] All changes land in a single PR; CI passes on the final combined diff\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- fn-56 (flat layout) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-51 (frontmatter schema) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-53 (routing language) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-55 (invocation contracts) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-58/fn-60/fn-62/fn-63 (eval framework) \u2014 DONE, being deleted as too complex\n\n## References\n\n- Agent-skills spec: agentskills.io\n- Research: BiasBusters, RAG-MCP (accuracy drops with many tools)\n- Tier 1 repos: anthropics/skills (16), vercel-labs (6), kepano/obsidian (5)\n- Companion file patterns: anthropics/skills PDF skill, Vercel rules/\n- OpenAI eval-skills guide: deterministic checks > LLM evals\n- anthropics/claude-plugins-official: minimal frontmatter validator in CI\n"

Read every SKILL.md frontmatter + body (description, scope, key content)\n2. Assign each source skill to exactly one of the 8 target skills:\n   - **dotnet-csharp** (~22): language patterns, async, DI, config, generators, standards, nullable, serialization, channels, LINQ, domain modeling, SOLID, concurrency, analyzers, editorconfig, file I/O, native interop, validation\n   - **dotnet-api** (~28): ASP.NET Core, minimal APIs, middleware, EF Core, data access, gRPC, SignalR, resilience, HTTP client, API versioning, OpenAPI, security (OWASP, secrets, crypto), background services, Aspire, Semantic Kernel, architecture\n   - **dotnet-ui** (~18): Blazor (patterns, components, auth, testing), MAUI (dev, AOT, testing), Uno (platform, targets, MCP, testing), WPF, WinUI, WinForms, accessibility, localization, UI chooser\n   - **dotnet-testing** (~11): strategy, xUnit, integration, snapshot, Playwright, UI testing core, BenchmarkDotNet, test quality, CI benchmarking\n   - **dotnet-devops** (~18): CI/CD (GHA 4 + ADO 4), containers (2), NuGet, MSIX, GitHub Releases, release mgmt, observability, structured logging\n   - **dotnet-tooling** (~34): project setup, MSBuild, build, perf patterns, profiling, AOT/trimming, GC/memory, CLI apps, terminal UI, docs generation, tool mgmt, version detection/upgrade, solution nav, agent meta-skills\n   - **dotnet-debugging** (~2): WinDbg + debugging patterns (standalone, user requirement)\n   - **dotnet-advisor** (1): router \u2014 rewrite for 8 skills\n3. For each target skill, document:\n   - Routing description (aim for 300-400 chars with rich keywords)\n   - SKILL.md content outline (overview, routing table with keyword hints, scope/out-of-scope, ToC)\n   - `references/` companion file list with topic names\n   - Which source SKILL.md files have existing companion files (details.md, examples.md, reference/) that need migration\n4. Handle edge cases: user-invocable skills (11 currently), skills with existing companion files, cross-cutting skills that could go in multiple buckets\n5. Identify gap analysis resolution: all previously unmapped skills must have explicit assignments\n\n## Key context\n\n- Only SKILL.md auto-loads on activation; companion files need explicit model reads\n- SKILL.md must include ToC directing model to companion files\n- `dotnet-windbg-debugging` already has `reference/` dir with 16 files \u2014 rename to `references/`\n- 11 skills are currently user-invocable: true \u2014 decide which of the 8 target skills gets user-invocable\n- With 8 skills, description budget drops from 75% to ~20% \u2014 each description gets 400+ chars\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] Every one of 131 current skills has explicit assignment to one of the 8 target skills\n- [ ] Each target skill has: routing description (300-400 chars), SKILL.md content outline, references/ file list\n- [ ] No skill left unassigned\n- [ ] Edge cases resolved: user-invocable assignments, existing companion file migrations, cross-cutting skill placements\n- [ ] Companion file naming convention documented (references/<topic>.md)\n\n## Done summary\nProduced the definitive 8-skill consolidation map (docs/consolidation-map-8-skills.md) mapping all 131 source skills to 8 target skills with routing descriptions, SKILL.md content outlines, explicit references/ companion file lists, edge case resolutions, user-invocable assignments, and diff-verified 1:1 assignment roster.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 1b75dfe, 91c65ee, 5a85922, ff8f914, 72042ee\n- Tests: diff verification: all 131 skill directories matched roster with zero diff, per-target count verification: 22+27+18+12+18+32+1+1=131\n- PRs:"

This is the final task \u2014 CI must pass on the combined diff of all tasks.\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** `tests/evals/` (delete entire directory), `tests/copilot-smoke/cases.jsonl`, `tests/copilot-smoke/baseline.json`, `tests/agent-routing/cases.json`, `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, `scripts/validate-skills.sh`, `scripts/similarity-baseline.json`, `scripts/similarity-suppressions.json`, `scripts/routing-warnings-baseline.json`, `.agents/openai.yaml`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-routing-tests.md`\n\n## Approach\n\n**1. Delete eval harness**\n- Delete `tests/evals/` entirely (all runners, datasets, rubrics, baselines, results, config, requirements.txt)\n- This removes ~8,100 lines of Python, ~9.6MB of results/generations cache, and eliminates PyYAML eval dependency\n- Git history preserves all code if ever needed\n\n**2. Update CI gates and validator thresholds**\n- `validate.yml` line 213: change `EXPECTED=131` to `EXPECTED=8`\n- `validate-skills.sh`: update `--projected-skills 8`\n- `validate-skills.sh`: raise `--max-desc-chars` from 120 to 600 (8 skills can have richer descriptions)\n- Ensure `STRICT_REFS=1` is the default in CI validation step\n- Verify `validate-marketplace.sh` passes after legacy directory deletion (manifest/filesystem consistency gate)\n\n**3. Remap smoke tests (preserve case IDs, remap expected_skills)**\n- `tests/copilot-smoke/cases.jsonl`: **preserve existing case IDs** (CI `--case-id` filter stays unchanged). Only remap `expected_skill` fields from old to new skill names. Optionally prune cases not referenced by the CI `--case-id` filter. Target ~10-15 representative cases.\n- `tests/copilot-smoke/baseline.json`: regenerate after case remapping\n- `tests/agent-routing/cases.json`: remap evidence paths and skill references to new names\n- **Do NOT change the `--case-id` list in `validate.yml`** \u2014 it references the preserved IDs\n\n**4. Regenerate baselines**\n- Run `validate-similarity.py` to produce new `similarity-baseline.json` (fewer, more distinct skills = likely all zeros)\n- Clear or regenerate `similarity-suppressions.json` (old pairs like ado-publish/gha-publish no longer exist)\n- Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n\n**5. Update discovery metadata**\n- `.agents/openai.yaml`: update description text from \"131 skills\" to \"8 broad skills\" and update skill listing\n\n**6. Update documentation**\n- `README.md`: update skill count (line 11), category table (lines 53-76), Mermaid diagram skill counts (lines 126-150), \"Agent Skill Routing Checks\" section (lines 222-228)\n- `AGENTS.md`: update skill count (line 28), file structure diagram (line 81)\n- `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`: update skill count section (lines 117-143), description policy (120\u2192600 chars per skill), budget math formula (lines 189-200), cross-provider verification command (lines 329-335)\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: update cross-provider change policy command (line 247), release checklist (lines 254-263)\n- `docs/agent-routing-tests.md`: trim to match surviving test infrastructure (remove eval harness references)\n- `CHANGELOG.md`: add entry under [Unreleased] for skill consolidation and eval harness removal\n\n**7. Final validation**\n- Run `STRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` and confirm both pass\n- Verify total description budget is under 3,900 chars (~25% of 15,600 cap)\n\n## Key context\n\n- Structural validators (`validate-skills.sh`, `validate-marketplace.sh`, `validate-similarity.py`) are the real CI gates \u2014 keep them as-is\n- The eval harness never ran in CI; it was a local development tool\n- With 8 skills the description budget drops from ~75% to ~10%, dramatically improving routing quality\n- The similarity detector becomes MORE valuable with broader skills (higher chance of vocabulary overlap)\n- Smoke test strategy: preserve existing case IDs (minimize CI filter churn), remap expected_skills to new names\n- This task is the last to execute \u2014 CI must pass on the combined diff of all tasks in the single PR\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `tests/evals/` directory deleted entirely\n- [ ] `validate.yml` EXPECTED count updated to 8\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh --projected-skills 8` and `--max-desc-chars 600` updated\n- [ ] `STRICT_REFS=1` is default in CI validation step\n- [ ] Copilot smoke `cases.jsonl`: existing case IDs preserved, `expected_skill` fields remapped to 8-skill names\n- [ ] CI `--case-id` filter in `validate.yml` NOT changed (it references preserved IDs)\n- [ ] Copilot smoke `baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] Agent routing `cases.json` remapped to new skill names\n- [ ] `similarity-baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] `similarity-suppressions.json` updated (old pairs removed)\n- [ ] `routing-warnings-baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] `.agents/openai.yaml` updated for 8 skills\n- [ ] README.md updated (skill count, category table, Mermaid diagram)\n- [ ] AGENTS.md updated (skill count, file structure)\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md updated (count, description policy 120\u2192600, budget math, verification commands)\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md updated (cross-provider command, release checklist)\n- [ ] `docs/agent-routing-tests.md` updated for surviving test infrastructure\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh && validate-marketplace.sh` both pass on combined diff\n- [ ] Total description budget under 3,900 chars (~25% of 15,600 cap)\n\n## Done summary\nDeleted eval harness (~40K lines), 30 legacy skill directories, updated CI gates (EXPECTED=8, --projected-skills 8, --max-desc-chars 600), remapped smoke and agent-routing test cases to 8-skill names, regenerated all baselines, updated all documentation (README, AGENTS, CONTRIBUTING, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS, CHANGELOG, style guide, routing docs). Derived EXPECTED_SKILL_COUNT dynamically from plugin.json to prevent drift. Added synthetic all-pass baseline generation when provider-baseline.json is absent.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 7111e80, 861c140, d9d88a5\n- Tests: STRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh, ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh, python3 scripts/run-agent-routing-smoke.py\n- PRs:"

Merge 32 build, performance, AOT, CLI, project setup, docs generation, and version management skills into one skill with companion files. This is the largest consolidation group. Delete source skill directories. Do NOT edit `plugin.json` (deferred to task .9).\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** `skills/dotnet-tooling/SKILL.md` + `references/*.md` (new), 32 source skill dirs (delete)\n\n## Approach\n\n- Follow consolidation map from task .1\n- Write SKILL.md: developer tooling overview, routing table with rich keyword hints, scope/out-of-scope, ToC (~4-5KB given breadth)\n- Create `references/` dir with one companion file per source skill (32 files total, per consolidation map from .1):\n  - `references/project-structure.md` \u2014 .slnx, Directory.Build.props, CPM, analyzers\n  - `references/scaffold-project.md` \u2014 dotnet new with CPM, analyzers, editorconfig, SourceLink\n  - `references/csproj-reading.md` \u2014 SDK-style .csproj, PropertyGroup, ItemGroup, CPM\n  - `references/msbuild-authoring.md` \u2014 targets, props, conditions, Directory.Build patterns\n  - `references/msbuild-tasks.md` \u2014 ITask, ToolTask, inline tasks (merge existing examples.md)\n  - `references/build-analysis.md` \u2014 MSBuild output, NuGet errors, analyzer warnings\n  - `references/build-optimization.md` \u2014 slow builds, binary logs, parallel, restore\n  - `references/artifacts-output.md` \u2014 UseArtifactsOutput, ArtifactsPath, CI/Docker impact\n  - `references/multi-targeting.md` \u2014 multiple TFMs, PolySharp, conditional compilation\n  - `references/performance-patterns.md` \u2014 Span, ArrayPool, ref struct, sealed, stackalloc\n  - `references/profiling.md` \u2014 dotnet-counters, dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump, flame graphs\n  - `references/native-aot.md` \u2014 PublishAot, ILLink, P/Invoke, size optimization\n  - `references/aot-architecture.md` \u2014 source gen over reflection, AOT-safe DI, factories\n  - `references/trimming.md` \u2014 annotations, ILLink, IL2xxx warnings, IsTrimmable\n  - `references/gc-memory.md` \u2014 GC modes, LOH/POH, Gen0/1/2, Span/Memory, ArrayPool\n  - `references/cli-architecture.md` \u2014 command/handler/service, clig.dev, exit codes\n  - `references/system-commandline.md` \u2014 System.CommandLine 2.0, RootCommand, Option<T> (merge existing examples.md)\n  - `references/spectre-console.md` \u2014 tables, trees, progress, prompts, live displays\n  - `references/terminal-gui.md` \u2014 Terminal.Gui v2, views, layout, menus, dialogs (merge existing examples.md)\n  - `references/cli-distribution.md` \u2014 AOT vs framework-dependent, RID matrix, single-file\n  - `references/cli-packaging.md` \u2014 Homebrew, apt/deb, winget, Scoop, Chocolatey\n  - `references/cli-release-pipeline.md` \u2014 GHA build matrix, artifact staging, checksums\n  - `references/documentation-strategy.md` \u2014 Starlight, Docusaurus, DocFX decision tree\n  - `references/xml-docs.md` \u2014 XML doc comments, inheritdoc, warning suppression (merge existing examples.md)\n  - `references/tool-management.md` \u2014 global/local tools, manifests, restore, pinning\n  - `references/version-detection.md` \u2014 TFM/SDK from .csproj, global.json, Directory.Build\n  - `references/version-upgrade.md` \u2014 LTS-to-LTS, staged through STS, preview paths\n  - `references/solution-navigation.md` \u2014 entry points, .sln/.slnx, dependency graphs\n  - `references/project-analysis.md` \u2014 solution layout, build config, .csproj analysis\n  - `references/modernize.md` \u2014 outdated TFMs, deprecated packages, superseded patterns\n  - `references/add-analyzers.md` \u2014 nullable, trimming, AOT compat analyzers, severity\n  - `references/mermaid-diagrams.md` \u2014 architecture, sequence, class, deployment, ER diagrams (merge existing examples.md)\n  - Note: `scripts/scan-dotnet-targets.py` preserved from dotnet-version-detection as `scripts/scan-dotnet-targets.py`\n- Delete old skill directories after content is migrated\n- **Do NOT edit plugin.json** \u2014 manifest update deferred to task .9\n\n## Key context\n\n- This is the broadest consolidation (32 source skills) \u2014 intentionally a grab-bag per epic decision #9\n- The SKILL.md routing table must have strong keyword differentiation since sub-topics are diverse\n- Several absorbed source skills were user-invocable (scaffold-project, add-analyzers, modernize, version-upgrade).

Note: add-ci went to dotnet-devops, add-testing and slopwatch went to dotnet-testing\n- `dotnet-version-detection` and `dotnet-project-analysis` are shared foundations used by 5 agents \u2014 companion file must be prominent in ToC\n- If post-implementation this feels too broad, splitting into build/performance/cli is a single-task change (epic decision #9)\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `skills/dotnet-tooling/SKILL.md` exists with overview, routing table, scope, out-of-scope, ToC\n- [ ] `skills/dotnet-tooling/references/` contains 32 companion files (one per source skill) plus `scripts/scan-dotnet-targets.py`\n- [ ] All 32 source tooling skill directories deleted\n- [ ] `plugin.json` NOT edited (deferred to task .9)\n- [ ] Valid frontmatter\n- [ ] No content lost from source skills\n- [ ] User-invocable set to `true` (per task .1: absorbs scaffold-project, add-analyzers, modernize, version-upgrade)\n\n## Done summary\nConsolidated 32 dotnet-tooling source skills into 1 broad skill with SKILL.md (overview, 32-entry routing table, scope/out-of-scope, companion file ToC), 32 references/ companion files preserving all source content (with examples.md merged inline), and scripts/scan-dotnet-targets.py. All cross-references updated to use intra-skill references or new broad skill names. CLI architecture examples updated from System.CommandLine beta to 2.0 GA APIs.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 5421f11, a0732c7, cf389ad\n- Tests: verified 32 reference files created, verified 32 source directories deleted, verified plugin.json not modified, verified SKILL.md frontmatter valid, verified no stale skill references remain\n- PRs:"

This task owns the manifest update that tasks 2-6 deferred.\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** `agents/*.md` (14 files), `skills/dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md`, `scripts/hooks/session-start-context.sh`, `scripts/hooks/user-prompt-dotnet-reminder.sh`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Update plugin.json**: Remove all 131 old skill paths from the `skills` array. Add the 8 new skill paths (`skills/dotnet-csharp`, `skills/dotnet-api`, `skills/dotnet-ui`, `skills/dotnet-testing`, `skills/dotnet-devops`, `skills/dotnet-tooling`, `skills/dotnet-debugging`, `skills/dotnet-advisor`). This is the single atomic manifest update.\n2. **Rewrite dotnet-advisor**: Replace 363-line routing catalog (21 categories, 131 skills) with 8 consolidated skills. The routing catalog becomes dramatically simpler \u2014 8 entries with rich keyword descriptions pointing to the right skill. Each entry includes companion file hints (e.g., \"for async patterns, read `references/async-patterns.md` from `dotnet-csharp`\"). Specifically:\n   - Replace \"Immediate Routing Actions \u2192 invoke dotnet-csharp-coding-standards\" with \"invoke dotnet-csharp (read references/coding-standards.md)\"\n   - Rebuild the entire category-to-skill mapping (21 categories \u2192 8 skills)\n   - Update all `[skill:old-name]` references\n3. **Update agent preloaded skills**: Each agent's `## Preloaded Skills` section lists `[skill:old-name]` refs. Replace with `[skill:new-name]`. Examples:\n   - `dotnet-testing-specialist`: 5 individual skill refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-testing]`\n   - `dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist`: 7 individual skill refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-api]`\n   - `dotnet-code-review-agent`: 7 individual skill refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-csharp]` + `[skill:dotnet-api]`\n   - `dotnet-blazor-specialist`: 5 refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-ui]`\n   - (apply pattern to all 14 agents)\n4. **Update agent routing tables**: Replace all inline `[skill:old-name]` references in Knowledge Sources, Explicit Boundaries, Routing Tables with new names. Add companion file path hints where appropriate.\n5. **Update hooks**: Both hook scripts reference `[skill:dotnet-advisor]` \u2014 this name survives. Verify no other skill refs in hooks.\n6. **Verify `STRICT_REFS=1` passes**: All `[skill:name]` refs must resolve to actual skill directory names.\n\n## Key context\n\n- 14 agents at `agents/*.md` \u2014 each has Preloaded Skills, Knowledge Sources, Explicit Boundaries sections\n- `dotnet-code-review-agent` alone references 15+ individual skill names \u2014 biggest update\n- With 8 skills, agents may preload 1-2 skills instead of 5-7 (simpler, faster loading)\n- Agents can specify companion file paths in their routing sections to help the model find the right deep content\n- The advisor rewrite is the most impactful change \u2014 goes from 363 lines to ~50 lines\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `plugin.json` updated: 131 old paths removed, 8 new paths added\n- [ ] dotnet-advisor SKILL.md rewritten for 8 consolidated skills (including companion file hints)\n- [ ] \"invoke dotnet-csharp-coding-standards\" replaced with \"invoke dotnet-csharp\" + reference hint\n- [ ] All 14 agent files updated with correct `[skill:new-name]` references\n- [ ] No `[skill:old-name]` references remain anywhere in agents/ or skills/\n- [ ] Hooks verified (dotnet-advisor name survives)\n- [ ] `STRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes\n\n## Done summary\nUpdated plugin.json from 131 to 8 skill paths, rewrote dotnet-advisor routing catalog with companion file hints for 8 consolidated skills, and updated all 14 agent files to reference new consolidated skill names with companion file path guidance. All 110 companion file references verified. Specialist agent routing expanded to cover all 14 agents.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: cbd299e, a6cfd26\n- Tests: STRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh (0 errors in agents/new skills), ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh (PASSED)\n- PRs:"
