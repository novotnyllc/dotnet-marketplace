    "spec": "# Consolidate 131 Skills into 8 Broad Skills\n\n## Overview\n\nThe plugin has 131 individual skills consuming 75% of the 15,600-char routing description budget. Research shows Tier 1 plugin repos converge on 5-16 skills (Vercel: 6, kepano/obsidian: 5, anthropics/skills: 16). RAG-MCP research shows routing accuracy drops from 43% to 13% with many tools. This epic consolidates 131 skills into 8 broad skills (6 content + debugging + advisor) with companion files for depth. With 8 skills, each description gets 400+ chars (vs 120 today) for dramatically better routing signal while using only ~20% of the budget.\n\n**The 8 skills:**\n\n| # | Skill | Source skills | What merges in |\n|---|-------|:---:|---|\n| 1 | **dotnet-csharp** | ~22 | Language patterns, async, DI, config, generators, standards, nullable types, serialization, channels, LINQ, domain modeling, SOLID, concurrency, analyzers, editorconfig, file I/O, native interop, validation |\n| 2 | **dotnet-api** | ~28 | ASP.NET Core, minimal APIs, middleware, EF Core, data access, gRPC, SignalR, resilience, HTTP client, API versioning, OpenAPI, security (OWASP, secrets, crypto), background services, Aspire, Semantic Kernel, architecture patterns |\n| 3 | **dotnet-ui** | ~18 | Blazor (patterns, components, auth, testing), MAUI (dev, AOT, testing), Uno (platform, targets, MCP, testing), WPF, WinUI, WinForms, accessibility, localization, UI chooser |\n| 4 | **dotnet-testing** | ~11 | Strategy, xUnit, integration, snapshot, Playwright, UI testing core, BenchmarkDotNet, test quality, CI benchmarking |\n| 5 | **dotnet-devops** | ~18 | CI/CD (GHA 4 + ADO 4), containers (2), NuGet, MSIX, GitHub Releases, release management, observability, structured logging |\n| 6 | **dotnet-tooling** | ~34 | Project setup, MSBuild, build, perf patterns, profiling, AOT/trimming, GC/memory, CLI apps, terminal UI, docs generation, tool management, version detection/upgrade, solution nav |\n| 7 | **dotnet-debugging** | ~2 | Standalone (user requirement). WinDbg + debugging patterns |\n| 8 | **dotnet-advisor** | 1 | Router/dispatcher (rewritten for 8 skills) |\n\nEach consolidated skill gets:\n- **SKILL.md** (auto-loaded on activation): overview, routing table, scope/out-of-scope, ToC pointing to companion files (~2-5KB)\n- **references/** directory: topic-named companion files with deep content from merged source skills (read on demand)\n\n## Scope\n\n- Consolidate all 131 skill directories into 8 new skill directories\n- Create companion `references/` files preserving all source skill content\n- Rewrite `dotnet-advisor` routing catalog for 8 skills\n- Update all 14 agent preloaded skill references\n- Update hooks, CI gates, validators\n- Delete complex eval harness (`tests/evals/`) \u2014 structural validators only\n- Simplify copilot smoke tests for 8 skills\n- Update all documentation for new skill count\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Redirect stubs for old skill names (no external consumers)\n- New skill content (consolidation only, not enhancement)\n- Agent restructuring (agents stay as-is, just update references)\n- New eval framework (structural validators are sufficient)\n\n## Key decisions\n\n1. **8 skills, not ~20** \u2014 Tier 1 repos converge on 5-16 skills. With 8 skills at 400 chars each, routing signal per skill is 3x better than 20 skills at 120 chars. Companion files handle depth.\n2. **dotnet-advisor survives** \u2014 hooks inject it as mandatory first action; rewrite routing catalog for 8 skills\n3. **Big-bang migration** \u2014 CI count gates prevent incremental approach\n4. **Framework testing \u2192 UI framework group** \u2014 `dotnet-blazor-testing` \u2192 `dotnet-ui`, etc.\n5. **Companion file convention** \u2014 `references/` directory with topic-named `.md` files\n6. **SKILL.md includes explicit ToC** \u2014 directs model to read specific companion files on demand\n7. **debugging stays standalone** \u2014 user requirement\n8. **Delete eval harness, keep structural validators** \u2014 8,100-line Python eval harness never ran in CI. Structural validators catch the top bug classes deterministically in <5 seconds. With 8 skills, routing confusion drops dramatically.\n9. **dotnet-tooling as intentional grab-bag** \u2014 at 34 source skills it's the broadest group. Companion files (`references/msbuild.md`, `references/native-aot.md`, `references/cli-apps.md`, etc.) organize the depth. If it proves too broad post-implementation, splitting into build/performance/cli is a single-task change.\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n# Validate after changes\nSTRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] 8 consolidated skill directories replace 131 individual directories\n- [ ] All source skill content preserved in SKILL.md + references/ companion files\n- [ ] All 14 agents updated with correct [skill:new-name] references\n- [ ] dotnet-advisor rewritten for 8 skills (dramatically simpler routing catalog)\n- [ ] Hooks reference valid skill names\n- [ ] CI gates updated (EXPECTED count, --projected-skills)\n- [ ] `tests/evals/` directory deleted (eval harness removed)\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh && validate-marketplace.sh` both pass\n- [ ] Similarity baseline regenerated for 8 skills\n- [ ] Copilot smoke tests remapped for 8 skills\n- [ ] Description budget under 25% (currently 75%)\n- [ ] README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md updated with correct skill count\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- fn-56 (flat layout) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-51 (frontmatter schema) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-53 (routing language) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-55 (invocation contracts) \u2014 DONE\n- fn-58/fn-60/fn-62/fn-63 (eval framework) \u2014 DONE, being deleted as too complex\n\n## References\n\n- Agent-skills spec: agentskills.io\n- Research: BiasBusters, RAG-MCP (accuracy drops with many tools)\n- Tier 1 repos: anthropics/skills (16), vercel-labs (6), kepano/obsidian (5)\n- Companion file patterns: anthropics/skills PDF skill, Vercel rules/\n- OpenAI eval-skills guide: deterministic checks > LLM evals\n- anthropics/claude-plugins-official: minimal frontmatter validator in CI\n"

Read every SKILL.md frontmatter + body (description, scope, key content)\n2. Assign each source skill to exactly one of the 8 target skills:\n   - **dotnet-csharp** (~22): language patterns, async, DI, config, generators, standards, nullable, serialization, channels, LINQ, domain modeling, SOLID, concurrency, analyzers, editorconfig, file I/O, native interop, validation\n   - **dotnet-api** (~28): ASP.NET Core, minimal APIs, middleware, EF Core, data access, gRPC, SignalR, resilience, HTTP client, API versioning, OpenAPI, security (OWASP, secrets, crypto), background services, Aspire, Semantic Kernel, architecture\n   - **dotnet-ui** (~18): Blazor (patterns, components, auth, testing), MAUI (dev, AOT, testing), Uno (platform, targets, MCP, testing), WPF, WinUI, WinForms, accessibility, localization, UI chooser\n   - **dotnet-testing** (~11): strategy, xUnit, integration, snapshot, Playwright, UI testing core, BenchmarkDotNet, test quality, CI benchmarking\n   - **dotnet-devops** (~18): CI/CD (GHA 4 + ADO 4), containers (2), NuGet, MSIX, GitHub Releases, release mgmt, observability, structured logging\n   - **dotnet-tooling** (~34): project setup, MSBuild, build, perf patterns, profiling, AOT/trimming, GC/memory, CLI apps, terminal UI, docs generation, tool mgmt, version detection/upgrade, solution nav, agent meta-skills\n   - **dotnet-debugging** (~2): WinDbg + debugging patterns (standalone, user requirement)\n   - **dotnet-advisor** (1): router \u2014 rewrite for 8 skills\n3. For each target skill, document:\n   - Routing description (aim for 300-400 chars with rich keywords)\n   - SKILL.md content outline (overview, routing table with keyword hints, scope/out-of-scope, ToC)\n   - `references/` companion file list with topic names\n   - Which source SKILL.md files have existing companion files (details.md, examples.md, reference/) that need migration\n4. Handle edge cases: user-invocable skills (11 currently), skills with existing companion files, cross-cutting skills that could go in multiple buckets\n\n## Key context\n\n- Only SKILL.md auto-loads on activation; companion files need explicit model reads\n- SKILL.md must include ToC directing model to companion files\n- `dotnet-windbg-debugging` already has `reference/` dir with 16 files \u2014 rename to `references/`\n- 11 skills are currently user-invocable: true \u2014 decide which of the 8 target skills gets user-invocable\n- With 8 skills, description budget drops from 75% to ~20% \u2014 each description gets 400+ chars\n## Approach\n\n1. Read every SKILL.md frontmatter + body (size, description, scope, key content areas)\n2. Identify natural groupings by domain affinity, cross-reference patterns, and agent preloaded skills\n3. For each proposed consolidated skill, list:\n   - Source skills being merged\n   - What goes in SKILL.md overview (~2-5KB target)\n   - What goes in `references/<topic>.md` companion files\n   - Routing description (under 400 chars)\n4. Resolve all unmapped skills identified in gap analysis (~37 skills)\n5. Decide: dotnet-advisor routing catalog rewrite scope\n6. Decide: framework-specific testing skills placement (UI group vs testing group)\n7. Document companion file naming convention (`references/<topic>.md`)\n\n## Key context\n\n- Gap analysis identified 37 unmapped skills including: dotnet-advisor, dotnet-aspire-patterns, dotnet-semantic-kernel, dotnet-localization, dotnet-messaging-patterns, dotnet-domain-modeling, dotnet-background-services, framework-testing skills, agent meta-skills\n- Only SKILL.md auto-loads on activation; companion files need explicit model reads\n- SKILL.md must include ToC directing model to companion files\n- Target: ~20 consolidated skills, each under 400 chars description\n- Existing companion files: 2 details.md, 10 examples.md, 1 reference/ dir with 16 files \u2014 all must migrate\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] Every one of 131 current skills has explicit assignment to one of the 8 target skills\n- [ ] Each target skill has: routing description (300-400 chars), SKILL.md content outline, references/ file list\n- [ ] No skill left unassigned\n- [ ] Edge cases resolved: user-invocable assignments, existing companion file migrations, cross-cutting skill placements\n- [ ] Companion file naming convention documented (references/<topic>.md)\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"

Delete eval harness**\n- Delete `tests/evals/` entirely (all runners, datasets, rubrics, baselines, results, config, requirements.txt)\n- This removes ~8,100 lines of Python, ~9.6MB of results/generations cache, and eliminates PyYAML eval dependency\n- Git history preserves all code if ever needed\n\n**2. Update CI gates**\n- `validate.yml` line 213: change `EXPECTED=131` to actual consolidated count\n- `validate-skills.sh`: update `--projected-skills` argument\n- `validate.yml` copilot-smoke job (lines 287-433): update hardcoded `--case-id` filter to reference new case IDs\n- Ensure `STRICT_REFS=1` is the default in CI (catches broken cross-refs post-consolidation)\n\n**3. Remap smoke tests**\n- `tests/copilot-smoke/cases.jsonl`: remap all `expected_skill` fields from old to new skill names, reduce to ~10-15 representative cases (1 per consolidated skill + negative controls)\n- `tests/copilot-smoke/baseline.json`: regenerate after case remapping\n- `tests/agent-routing/cases.json`: remap evidence paths and skill references to new names\n\n**4. Regenerate baselines**\n- Run `validate-similarity.py` to produce new `similarity-baseline.json` (fewer, more distinct skills = likely all zeros)\n- Clear or regenerate `similarity-suppressions.json` (old pairs like ado-publish/gha-publish no longer exist)\n- Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n\n**5. Update documentation**\n- `README.md`: update skill count (line 11), category table (lines 53-76), Mermaid diagram skill counts (lines 126-150), \"Agent Skill Routing Checks\" section (lines 222-228)\n- `AGENTS.md`: update skill count (line 28), file structure diagram (line 81)\n- `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`: update Copilot 32-skill section count (lines 117-143), budget math formula (lines 189-200), cross-provider verification command (lines 329-335)\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: update cross-provider change policy command (line 247), release checklist (lines 254-263)\n- `docs/agent-routing-tests.md`: trim to match surviving test infrastructure (remove eval harness references)\n- `CHANGELOG.md`: add entry under [Unreleased] for skill consolidation and eval harness removal\n\n## Key context\n\n- Structural validators (`validate-skills.sh`, `validate-marketplace.sh`, `validate-similarity.py`) are the real CI gates \u2014 keep them as-is\n- The eval harness never ran in CI; it was a local development tool\n- With ~20 skills the description budget drops from ~75% to ~15-20%, dramatically improving routing quality\n- The similarity detector becomes MORE valuable with broader skills (higher chance of vocabulary overlap)\n- All eval JSONL datasets, rubrics, and baselines reference old 131-skill names \u2014 remapping would be as much work as deletion, with no CI benefit\n## Approach\n\n1. **CI gates**: Update `EXPECTED=N` in `validate.yml:213`, `--projected-skills N` in `validate-skills.sh:71` to match actual consolidated count\n2. **Similarity baseline**: Regenerate `similarity-baseline.json` (all zeros expected with fewer, more distinct skills)\n3. **Similarity suppressions**: Update or clear `similarity-suppressions.json` (old ado-publish/gha-publish pair no longer exists)\n4. **Routing warnings baseline**: Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n5. **Eval datasets**: Remap all `expected_skills`, `acceptable_skills`, `expected_skill` fields from old names to new names across activation (73 cases), confusion (54 cases), effectiveness (12 rubrics), size_impact (11 candidates)\n6. **Confusion matrix**: Rewrite `DOMAIN_GROUPS` dict in `run_confusion_matrix.py:46-88` for ~20 skills (may simplify significantly)\n7. **Copilot smoke tests**: Remap `cases.jsonl` and `baseline.json` (29 cases)\n8. **Agent routing tests**: Remap `cases.json` evidence paths\n9. **Documentation**: Update skill count and catalog in README.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, AGENTS.md\n\n## Key context\n\n- Description budget drops from ~75% to ~15-20% \u2014 significant routing quality improvement\n- Confusion matrix eval concept may simplify dramatically with only ~20 skills (fewer overlapping domains)\n- Eval dataset remapping is data changes only \u2014 no running of actual eval suites here\n## Approach\n\n1. **CI gates**: Update `EXPECTED=N` in `validate.yml:213`, `--projected-skills N` in `validate-skills.sh:71` to match actual consolidated count\n2. **Similarity baseline**: Regenerate `similarity-baseline.json` (all zeros expected with fewer, more distinct skills)\n3. **Similarity suppressions**: Update or clear `similarity-suppressions.json` (old ado-publish/gha-publish pair no longer exists)\n4. **Routing warnings baseline**: Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n5. **Eval datasets**: Remap all `expected_skills`, `acceptable_skills`, `expected_skill` fields from old names to new names across activation (73 cases), confusion (54 cases), effectiveness (12 rubrics), size_impact (11 candidates)\n6. **Confusion matrix**: Rewrite `DOMAIN_GROUPS` dict in `run_confusion_matrix.py:46-88` for ~20 skills (may simplify significantly)\n7. **Copilot smoke tests**: Remap `cases.jsonl` and `baseline.json` (29 cases)\n8. **Agent routing tests**: Remap `cases.json` evidence paths\n9. **Documentation**: Update skill count and catalog in README.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, AGENTS.md\n10. **Run full eval suite**: All 4 types (activation, confusion, effectiveness, size_impact), save new baselines\n\n## Key context\n\n- Description budget drops from ~75% to ~15-20% \u2014 significant routing quality improvement\n- Confusion matrix eval concept may simplify dramatically with only ~20 skills (fewer overlapping domains)\n- Eval baselines from fn-60 must be fully regenerated \u2014 old baselines are keyed by old skill names\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `tests/evals/` directory deleted entirely\n- [ ] `validate.yml` EXPECTED count updated to match actual consolidated skill count\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh --projected-skills` updated to new count\n- [ ] `STRICT_REFS=1` is default in CI validation step\n- [ ] Copilot smoke `cases.jsonl` remapped to new skill names (~10-15 cases)\n- [ ] Copilot smoke `baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] Agent routing `cases.json` remapped to new skill names\n- [ ] `similarity-baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] `similarity-suppressions.json` updated (old pairs removed)\n- [ ] `routing-warnings-baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] README.md updated (skill count, category table, Mermaid diagram)\n- [ ] AGENTS.md updated (skill count, file structure)\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md updated (count, budget math, verification commands)\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md updated (cross-provider command, release checklist)\n- [ ] `docs/agent-routing-tests.md` updated for surviving test infrastructure\n- [ ] `./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` both pass\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"

Examples:\n   - `dotnet-testing-specialist`: 5 individual skill refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-testing]`\n   - `dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist`: 7 individual skill refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-api]`\n   - `dotnet-code-review-agent`: 7 individual skill refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-csharp]` + `[skill:dotnet-api]`\n   - `dotnet-blazor-specialist`: 5 refs \u2192 `[skill:dotnet-ui]`\n   - (apply pattern to all 14 agents)\n3. **Update agent routing tables**: Replace all inline `[skill:old-name]` references in Knowledge Sources, Explicit Boundaries, Routing Tables with new names.\n4. **Update hooks**: Both hook scripts reference `[skill:dotnet-advisor]` \u2014 this name survives. Verify no other skill refs in hooks.\n5. **Verify `STRICT_REFS=1` passes**: All `[skill:name]` refs must resolve to actual skill directory names.\n\n## Key context\n\n- 14 agents at `agents/*.md` \u2014 each has Preloaded Skills, Knowledge Sources, Explicit Boundaries sections\n- `dotnet-code-review-agent` alone references 15+ individual skill names \u2014 biggest update\n- With 8 skills, agents may preload 1-2 skills instead of 5-7 (simpler, faster loading)\n- Agents can specify companion file paths in their routing sections to help the model find the right deep content\n- The advisor rewrite is the most impactful change \u2014 goes from 363 lines to ~50 lines\n## Approach\n\n1. **Rewrite dotnet-advisor**: Replace 363-line routing catalog (21 categories, 131 skills) with ~20 consolidated skills. Dramatically simpler decision tree.\n2. **Update agent preloaded skills**: Each agent's `## Preloaded Skills` section lists `[skill:old-name]` refs. Replace with `[skill:new-name]`. Example: `dotnet-testing-specialist` changes from 5 individual skill refs to `[skill:dotnet-testing]`.\n3. **Update agent routing tables**: Inline `[skill:]` references in Knowledge Sources, Explicit Boundaries, Routing Tables.\n4. **Update hooks**: Both hook scripts reference `[skill:dotnet-advisor]` \u2014 this name survives, but verify no other skill refs in hooks.\n5. **Verify `STRICT_REFS=1` passes**: All `[skill:name]` refs must resolve to actual skill directory names.\n\n## Key context\n\n- 14 agents at `agents/*.md`: dotnet-architect, dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist, dotnet-async-performance-specialist, dotnet-benchmark-designer, dotnet-blazor-specialist, dotnet-cloud-specialist, dotnet-code-review-agent, dotnet-csharp-async-patterns (wait \u2014 check this is an agent not skill), dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist, dotnet-maui-specialist, dotnet-performance-analyst, dotnet-security-reviewer, dotnet-testing-specialist, dotnet-uno-specialist\n- Each agent has Preloaded Skills, Knowledge Sources, Explicit Boundaries sections with `[skill:]` refs\n- `dotnet-code-review-agent` alone references 15+ individual skill names\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] dotnet-advisor SKILL.md rewritten for 8 consolidated skills\n- [ ] All 14 agent files updated with correct `[skill:new-name]` references\n- [ ] No `[skill:old-name]` references remain anywhere in agents/ or skills/\n- [ ] Hooks verified (dotnet-advisor name survives)\n- [ ] `STRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"
