    "spec": "# fn-10: Version Detection & Multi-Targeting\n\n## Overview\nDelivers skills for .NET version detection, multi-targeting strategies with polyfills, and modern .NET version upgrades.\n\n## Scope\n**Skills:**\n- `dotnet-multi-targeting` - Multi-targeting strategies with polyfill emphasis: PolySharp, SimonCropp/Polyfill, conditional compilation, API compat analyzers\n- `dotnet-version-upgrade` - Modern .NET version upgrades (.NET 8 -> 10 -> 11). Forward-looking polyfill usage for latest features on all targets.\n\n## Key Context\n- Version detection is foundational for all other skills (reads TFMs from .csproj, Directory.Build.props, global.json)\n- Skills must adapt output based on detected TFM (net8.0, net9.0, net10.0, net11.0)\n- PolySharp and SimonCropp/Polyfill enable latest language features on older TFMs\n- .NET 11 preview detection requires checking LangVersion=preview and EnablePreviewFeatures\n- Multi-targeting strategy: prefer polyfills over conditional compilation\n\n## Quick Commands\n```bash\n# Smoke test: verify version detection logic\ngrep -i \"TFM\\|TargetFramework\" skills/version/dotnet-multi-targeting.md\n\n# Validate polyfill coverage\ngrep -i \"PolySharp\\|Polyfill\" skills/version/dotnet-multi-targeting.md\n\n# Test upgrade guidance\ngrep -i \"upgrade\\|migration\" skills/version/dotnet-version-upgrade.md\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. Both skills written with standard depth and frontmatter\n2. Multi-targeting skill emphasizes PolySharp and SimonCropp/Polyfill for modern features on older TFMs\n3. Version upgrade skill provides .NET 8 -> 10 -> 11 migration paths\n4. Skills document TFM detection from .csproj, Directory.Build.props, global.json\n5. .NET 11 preview feature detection covered (LangVersion=preview, EnablePreviewFeatures)\n6. Cross-references to other skills that depend on version detection\n7. API compatibility analyzers documented for multi-targeting validation\n\n## Test Notes\n- Test multi-targeting skill with polyfill examples (e.g., using C# 12 features on net8.0)\n- Verify version upgrade skill detects deprecated packages and patterns\n- Validate TFM detection logic with sample .csproj files\n\n## References\n- PolySharp: https://github.com/Sergio0694/PolySharp\n- SimonCropp Polyfill: https://github.com/SimonCropp/Polyfill\n- .NET Multi-Targeting: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks\n- .NET Upgrade Assistant: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant\n"
