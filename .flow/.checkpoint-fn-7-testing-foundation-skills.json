    "spec": "# fn-7: Testing Foundation Skills\n\n## Overview\nDelivers comprehensive testing foundation covering strategy, xUnit v3, integration testing, UI testing across frameworks (Blazor, MAUI, Uno), Playwright, snapshot testing, and test quality analysis.\n\n## Scope Boundary\n**In scope:** Testing design patterns, testing framework usage, test quality analysis, and testing strategy guidance.\n\n**Out of scope / Owned by other skills:**\n- Test project scaffolding (directory layout, xUnit project creation, coverlet setup, editorconfig overrides) -- owned by [skill:dotnet-add-testing]\n- CI test reporting and pipeline integration -- owned by fn-19\n\nThe boundary is: `dotnet-add-testing` handles \"how to create a test project\"; fn-7 skills handle \"how to write effective tests.\"\n\n## Skills\nEach skill lives at `skills/testing/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (folder-per-skill convention).\n\n- `dotnet-testing-strategy` -- Core testing patterns: unit vs integration vs E2E decision tree, test organization, naming conventions, when to use mocks vs fakes vs stubs\n- `dotnet-xunit` -- xUnit v3 features: `[Fact]`/`[Theory]`, fixtures (`IClassFixture`, `ICollectionFixture`), parallel execution, `IAsyncLifetime`, custom assertions, analyzers; includes xUnit v2 compatibility notes\n- `dotnet-integration-testing` -- WebApplicationFactory, Testcontainers, Aspire testing patterns, database fixtures, test isolation\n- `dotnet-ui-testing-core` -- Core UI testing patterns applicable across frameworks: page object model, test selectors, async wait strategies, accessibility testing\n- `dotnet-blazor-testing` -- bUnit for Blazor component testing: rendering, events, cascading parameters, JS interop mocking\n- `dotnet-maui-testing` -- Appium + XHarness for MAUI testing: device/emulator testing, platform-specific behavior\n- `dotnet-uno-testing` -- Playwright for Uno WASM, platform-specific testing, runtime heads\n- `dotnet-playwright` -- Playwright for .NET: browser automation, E2E testing, CI caching, trace viewer, codegen\n- `dotnet-snapshot-testing` -- Verify (VerifyTests): API surfaces, HTTP responses, rendered emails, scrubbing/filtering, custom converters\n- `dotnet-test-quality` -- Code coverage (coverlet + ReportGenerator), CRAP analysis, mutation testing (Stryker.NET), flaky test detection\n\n## Minimum Supported Versions\n- xUnit: v3 primary, v2 compatibility notes where behavior differs\n- .NET: 8.0+ (LTS baseline); note when features require 9.0+ or 10.0+\n- Playwright: 1.40+ for .NET\n- Testcontainers: 3.x+\n- Verify: 20.x+\n\n## Cross-Reference Matrix\nEach skill MUST include outbound `[skill:...]` cross-references as follows:\n\n| Skill | Required Outbound Refs |\n|---|---|\n| `dotnet-testing-strategy` | `dotnet-xunit`, `dotnet-integration-testing`, `dotnet-snapshot-testing`, `dotnet-test-quality`, `dotnet-add-testing` |\n| `dotnet-xunit` | `dotnet-testing-strategy`, `dotnet-integration-testing` |\n| `dotnet-integration-testing` | `dotnet-testing-strategy`, `dotnet-xunit`, `dotnet-snapshot-testing` |\n| `dotnet-ui-testing-core` | `dotnet-testing-strategy`, `dotnet-playwright`, `dotnet-blazor-testing`, `dotnet-maui-testing`, `dotnet-uno-testing` |\n| `dotnet-blazor-testing` | `dotnet-ui-testing-core`, `dotnet-xunit` |\n| `dotnet-maui-testing` | `dotnet-ui-testing-core`, `dotnet-xunit` |\n| `dotnet-uno-testing` | `dotnet-ui-testing-core`, `dotnet-playwright` |\n| `dotnet-playwright` | `dotnet-ui-testing-core`, `dotnet-testing-strategy` |\n| `dotnet-snapshot-testing` | `dotnet-testing-strategy`, `dotnet-integration-testing` |\n| `dotnet-test-quality` | `dotnet-testing-strategy`, `dotnet-xunit` |\n\n## fn-7 Reconciliation Scope\nAfter all fn-7 skills land, replace ALL `<!-- TODO: fn-7 reconciliation -->` and `<!-- TODO(fn-7): ... -->` placeholders across the `skills/` directory with canonical `[skill:...]` cross-references. Affected skills span TWO categories:\n\n**Architecture** (tracked in `skills/architecture/FN7-RECONCILIATION.md`):\n`dotnet-architecture-patterns`, `dotnet-background-services`, `dotnet-resilience`, `dotnet-http-client`, `dotnet-observability`, `dotnet-efcore-patterns`, `dotnet-efcore-architecture`, `dotnet-data-access-strategy`, `dotnet-containers`, `dotnet-container-deployment`\n\n**Serialization**:\n`dotnet-serialization`, `dotnet-grpc`, `dotnet-service-communication`, `dotnet-realtime-communication`\n\nVerification after reconciliation:\n```bash\n# Confirm no fn-7 TODOs remain in skills/\ngrep -rl \"TODO.*fn-7\\|fn-7.*TODO\" skills/  # expect empty\n```\n\n## Quick Commands\n```bash\n# Smoke test: verify testing strategy skill exists\nls skills/testing/dotnet-testing-strategy/SKILL.md\n\n# Validate xUnit v3 coverage\ngrep -i \"xunit.*v3\" skills/testing/dotnet-xunit/SKILL.md\n\n# Test snapshot testing patterns\ngrep -i \"Verify\" skills/testing/dotnet-snapshot-testing/SKILL.md\n\n# Verify all 10 skills registered in plugin.json\ngrep -c \"skills/testing/\" .claude-plugin/plugin.json  # expect 10\n\n# Verify no fn-7 TODOs remain\ngrep -rl \"TODO.*fn-7\" skills/  # expect empty after reconciliation\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. All 10 skills written at `skills/testing/<name>/SKILL.md` with required frontmatter (`name`, `description`)\n2. Each skill has: description, scope boundary, prerequisites, cross-references, \u22652 practical code examples, gotchas/pitfalls section, references\n3. Testing strategy skill provides decision tree for unit/integration/E2E with concrete criteria\n4. xUnit skill covers v3 features with v2 compatibility notes where behavior differs\n5. Integration testing skill documents WebApplicationFactory + Testcontainers + Aspire testing patterns\n6. UI testing skills cover framework-specific patterns (bUnit, Appium, Playwright) with `dotnet-ui-testing-core` owning shared patterns\n7. Snapshot testing skill uses Verify library with scrubbing/filtering and custom converter examples\n8. Test quality skill covers coverage (coverlet + ReportGenerator), CRAP analysis, mutation testing (Stryker.NET)\n9. Cross-references validated against the cross-reference matrix above (grep-based check)\n10. All 10 skills registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` skills array\n11. All `TODO(fn-7)` and `TODO: fn-7 reconciliation` placeholders in `skills/` replaced with canonical `[skill:...]` refs\n12. Updated `skills/architecture/FN7-RECONCILIATION.md` verification commands to include serialization scope\n\n## Test Notes\n- Validate xUnit skill theory and fixture examples compile conceptually\n- Verify Playwright skill includes CI caching patterns (browser binary caching)\n- Check snapshot testing skill covers scrubbing/filtering patterns for dates, GUIDs\n- Confirm cross-reference matrix compliance with grep\n- Confirm no overlap with `dotnet-add-testing` (scaffolding) -- fn-7 skills reference it, not duplicate it\n\n## References\n- xUnit Documentation: https://xunit.net/\n- WebApplicationFactory: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests\n- Testcontainers: https://dotnet.testcontainers.org/\n- Playwright for .NET: https://playwright.dev/dotnet/\n- Verify: https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify\n- Coverlet: https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet\n- Stryker.NET: https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/introduction/\n"
