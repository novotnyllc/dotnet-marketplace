    "spec": "# fn-42 Restructure Repo into Marketplace with Plugin Subdirectories\n\n## Overview\n\nRestructure `novotnyllc/dotnet-artisan` from a flat single-plugin repo into a **marketplace** that hosts plugins in subdirectories, following the `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` pattern. Move the entire dotnet-artisan plugin into `plugins/dotnet-artisan/`. Clean up stale artifacts from completed epics. Remove the dist generation pipeline entirely \u2014 source files ARE the plugin.\n\nUsers install via:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add novotnyllc/dotnet-artisan\n/plugin install dotnet-artisan\n```\n\n## Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n- Delete stale files: fleet review docs, review reports, ralph run logs, dist/ pipeline (generate_dist.py, validate_cross_agent.py), dist/ output\n- Move all dotnet-artisan content to `plugins/dotnet-artisan/` with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n- Delete root `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` atomically during the restructure (Task 2), not before\n- Move plugin-specific docs (`docs/hooks-and-mcp-guide.md`, `docs/dotnet-artisan-spec.md`) into plugin\n- Create root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` listing available plugins\n- Per-plugin versioning (tag format: `dotnet-artisan/v*`)\n- Update CI workflows for new structure (remove dist steps, per-plugin paths)\n- Add `.agents/openai.yaml` at repo root for Codex skill discovery\n- Add root marketplace.json validation to CI\n- Update CHANGELOG.md with marketplace restructure entry\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n- Copilot/Codex platform-specific output generation (future epic)\n- Adding additional plugins to the marketplace\n- MCP registry or Copilot plugin marketplace registration\n- Modifying any skill/agent content (purely structural, except fixing the README agent count from 9 to 14 during the move)\n\n## Target Structure\n\n```\n/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .claude-plugin/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 marketplace.json              # Root: lists available plugins\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 dotnet-artisan/\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 .claude-plugin/\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugin.json           # Per-plugin manifest (122 skills, 14 agents)\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 marketplace.json      # Per-plugin metadata (author, keywords, etc.)\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 skills/                   # 122 skills (22 categories, unchanged internally)\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 agents/                   # 14 specialist agents\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks/\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 hooks.json            # Session hooks (uses ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT})\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks/                # Hook shell scripts\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 validate-skills.sh\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 _validate_skills.py\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 validate-marketplace.sh\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/                    # Test suite (trigger-corpus.json, etc.)\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/                     # Plugin-specific docs\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks-and-mcp-guide.md\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 dotnet-artisan-spec.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 .mcp.json                 # MCP server config\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 AGENTS.md                 # Skill routing + agent delegation\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 CLAUDE.md                 # Plugin instructions\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md    # Skill authoring guide\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .agents/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 openai.yaml                   # Codex skill discovery metadata\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 workflows/                    # CI (validate.yml, release.yml)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .flow/                            # Planning (stays at root)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ralph/                        # Dev tooling (stays at root, minus runs/)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md                         # Marketplace-level overview\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CONTRIBUTING.md                   # Marketplace-level contribution guide\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CHANGELOG.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n```\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Marketplace pattern**: Follow `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` \u2014 root `marketplace.json` with `\"source\": \"./plugins/dotnet-artisan\"`, each plugin has own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Verify the exact marketplace.json schema from that repo before authoring; do not invent fields.\n\n2. **No dist pipeline**: Source files ARE the final output. Claude Code reads directly from the plugin directory. No generation, no transformation, no build step for developers.\n\n3. **Hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**: Already platform-relative. When installed, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` resolves to the plugin's cached location. No path changes needed inside hooks.json or hook scripts.\n\n4. **Per-plugin versioning**: Version in `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Tag format: `dotnet-artisan/v0.1.0`. Release workflow scoped to plugin-prefixed tags.\n\n5. **Skill paths unchanged inside plugin**: All paths in plugin.json are relative to the plugin root. Moving the plugin to a subdirectory doesn't change any internal references \u2014 `skills/foundation/dotnet-advisor` stays the same.\n\n6. **Root plugin.json deleted atomically**: The old root `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is deleted in Task 2 (the restructure task) at the same time the replacement marketplace.json and per-plugin plugin.json are created. This prevents any window where the repo has no discoverable manifest.\n\n7. **Dev tooling stays at root**: `scripts/ralph/` (minus `runs/`) stays at repo root since it's repo-level dev tooling, not plugin content. `.flow/` stays at root.\n\n8. **Feature branch workflow**: All tasks happen on a feature branch. Intermediate CI breakage is acceptable \u2014 only the final PR merge must pass.\n\n9. **Validation split**: `validate-marketplace.sh` validates only per-plugin manifests (run from plugin dir). Root `marketplace.json` validation (JSON valid + source paths resolve) happens in the CI workflow directly.\n\n10. **trigger-corpus.json**: Moves with the plugin to `plugins/dotnet-artisan/tests/`. Its only consumer (`validate_cross_agent.py`) is deleted. It remains as test data that could be used by future skill validation \u2014 not deleted, but noted as currently without an active consumer.\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n# From plugin directory\ncd plugins/dotnet-artisan\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n# Root marketplace validation (in CI)\njq empty .claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/` contains the complete plugin (122 skills, 14 agents, hooks, scripts, .mcp.json)\n- [ ] Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists dotnet-artisan with `\"source\": \"./plugins/dotnet-artisan\"` \u2014 schema verified against `anthropics/claude-plugins-official`\n- [ ] Root `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is DELETED (no ambiguous discovery)\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` has all skill/agent/hook/mcp paths (relative to plugin root, unchanged)\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has plugin metadata (author, keywords, categories)\n- [ ] Per-plugin version in plugin manifest; release workflow uses `dotnet-artisan/v*` tag pattern\n- [ ] Stale files deleted: `docs/fleet-review-rubric.md`, `docs/review-reports/`, `scripts/ralph/runs/`, `dist/`, `scripts/generate_dist.py`, `scripts/validate_cross_agent.py`\n- [ ] `.gitignore` updated (no `dist/` entry; no new entries needed \u2014 existing root patterns cover build artifacts globally)\n- [ ] CI `validate.yml` validates root marketplace.json AND runs plugin validation from subdirectory, no dist steps\n- [ ] CI `release.yml` uses per-plugin tags, no Pages deployment\n- [ ] `.agents/openai.yaml` exists at repo root with valid, parseable YAML\n- [ ] Hooks work correctly with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` from the subdirectory location\n- [ ] Plugin-specific docs moved: `docs/hooks-and-mcp-guide.md`, `docs/dotnet-artisan-spec.md` \u2192 `plugins/dotnet-artisan/docs/`\n- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with [Unreleased] entry documenting the marketplace restructure\n\n## References\n\n- `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` marketplace pattern: root `marketplace.json` \u2192 `./plugins/<name>/`\n- `trailofbits/skills-curated` uses same `plugins/` + per-plugin `.claude-plugin/` pattern\n- Codex openai.yaml schema: `.agents/openai.yaml` at repo root\n- Agent Skills spec: https://agentskills.io/specification\n"

Delete root plugin.json atomically (replacement created in same task). Create the root marketplace structure. Update all documentation and validation scripts. Update CHANGELOG.md.\n\n**Size:** M (large M \u2014 involves ~140+ file moves, 3 new manifests, doc rewrites, validation script confirmation)\n**Files:** Entire repo structure, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (root), `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, docs, validation scripts, CHANGELOG.md\n\n## Approach\n\n### File Moves (git mv for history preservation)\n\nMove INTO `plugins/dotnet-artisan/`:\n- `skills/` (all 22 categories, 122 skills)\n- `agents/` (14 specialist agents)\n- `hooks/` (hooks.json)\n- `scripts/hooks/` (post-edit-dotnet.sh, session-start-context.sh)\n- `scripts/validate-skills.sh`, `scripts/_validate_skills.py`, `scripts/validate-marketplace.sh`\n- `.mcp.json`\n- `tests/`\n- `AGENTS.md` (skill routing + agent delegation)\n- `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`\n- `docs/hooks-and-mcp-guide.md` \u2192 `plugins/dotnet-artisan/docs/`\n- `docs/dotnet-artisan-spec.md` \u2192 `plugins/dotnet-artisan/docs/`\n\n**Important**: Use `git mv` for each move to preserve file history. Do all moves before modifying content to keep git tracking renames cleanly.\n\n### Root plugin.json Deletion\n\nDelete `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in this task (not Task 1). The replacement marketplace.json and per-plugin plugin.json are created in the same task, so there is no window where the repo lacks a discoverable manifest.\n\n### Manifest Changes\n\n**Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** (NEW \u2014 marketplace listing):\nFollow the `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` pattern. **Before authoring, verify the exact marketplace.json schema from that repo** \u2014 do not invent fields like `\"metadata\": {\"pluginRoot\": ...}`. Contains marketplace name, owner, and plugins array with source paths.\n\n**`plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** (MOVED \u2014 paths unchanged):\nAll skill, agent, hook, and MCP paths are relative to the plugin root. Since the internal structure stays the same, NO path changes needed inside plugin.json.\n\n**`plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** (MOVED \u2014 per-plugin metadata):\nThe existing marketplace.json (author, keywords, categories) moves here as per-plugin metadata.\n\n### Documentation Updates\n\n**Root `README.md`**: Rewrite as marketplace overview \u2014 what plugins are available, how to install, link to plugin READMEs.\n\n**`plugins/dotnet-artisan/README.md`**: Move current root README.md content here (skill catalog, architecture, installation). Update path references. Fix agent count from 9 to 14 (pre-existing error, minimal content fix during move).\n\n**Root `CLAUDE.md`**: Rewrite as minimal marketplace instructions. Point to plugin subdirectories for plugin-specific instructions.\n\n**`plugins/dotnet-artisan/CLAUDE.md`**: Move current CLAUDE.md here. Update file paths in \"File Structure\" and \"Validation Commands\" sections.\n\n**Root `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Keep at root. Update to remove dist generation references. Point to plugin-specific CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md.\n\n**`CHANGELOG.md`**: Add an [Unreleased] entry documenting the marketplace restructure (moved to plugins/, removed dist pipeline, per-plugin versioning). Historical 0.1.0 entries remain as-is for accuracy.\n\n### Validation Scripts\n\nMove `validate-skills.sh`, `_validate_skills.py`, `validate-marketplace.sh` into `plugins/dotnet-artisan/scripts/`. They use `$(dirname \"$0\")/..` for REPO_ROOT \u2014 after the move, this resolves to the plugin root, which is correct.\n\n**No cross-ref extraction needed**: `_validate_skills.py` already validates `[skill:name]` cross-references (lines 130-131, 293-305).\n\n**Validation split**: `validate-marketplace.sh` validates only per-plugin manifests (run from plugin dir). Root `marketplace.json` validation (JSON valid + source paths resolve) happens in the CI workflow (Task 3), not in this script.\n\n### trigger-corpus.json\n\nMoves with the plugin to `plugins/dotnet-artisan/tests/`. Its only consumer (`validate_cross_agent.py`) is deleted in Task 1. It remains as test data that could be consumed by future skill validation enhancements \u2014 not deleted, but noted as currently without an active consumer.\n\n### What Does NOT Change\n\n- Internal skill/agent/hook content (SKILL.md files, agent .md files, hook scripts)\n- Plugin.json skill/agent path arrays (already relative to plugin root)\n- Hook `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` references\n- `.mcp.json` content (context7 MCP servers)\n\n## Key Context\n\n- `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` is the canonical pattern: `plugins/{name}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n- Claude Code caches the plugin directory \u2014 all files must be self-contained within it\n- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set at install time \u2014 resolves to the plugin cached location\n- `validate-skills.sh` line 32: `REPO_ROOT=$(cd \"$(dirname \"$0\")/..\" && pwd)` \u2014 after move, this = plugin root\n- `_validate_skills.py` line 233: `skills_dir = repo_root / \"skills\"` \u2014 works since skills/ is inside plugin root\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/` contains: skills/ (122), agents/ (14), hooks/, scripts/, tests/, docs/, .mcp.json\n- [ ] Root `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is DELETED (done in this task, not Task 1)\n- [ ] Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists dotnet-artisan with `\"source\": \"./plugins/dotnet-artisan\"` \u2014 schema verified against `anthropics/claude-plugins-official`\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` present with unchanged internal paths\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has per-plugin metadata\n- [ ] Root README.md is marketplace-level; plugin README.md has skill catalog (agent count corrected to 14)\n- [ ] Root CLAUDE.md is minimal marketplace instructions; plugin CLAUDE.md has plugin instructions\n- [ ] `plugins/dotnet-artisan/AGENTS.md` has skill routing and agent delegation\n- [ ] Plugin docs moved: `plugins/dotnet-artisan/docs/hooks-and-mcp-guide.md`, `plugins/dotnet-artisan/docs/dotnet-artisan-spec.md`\n- [ ] Validation scripts work from plugin directory: `cd plugins/dotnet-artisan && ./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh`\n- [ ] No root-level orphaned files from the plugin (skills/, agents/, hooks/, .mcp.json etc. removed from root)\n- [ ] Empty `docs/` directory at root removed (if no files remain)\n- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with [Unreleased] entry for marketplace restructure\n## Done summary\nRestructured the dotnet-artisan repo from a flat single-plugin layout into a marketplace pattern. Moved all dotnet-artisan plugin content (122 skills, 14 agents, hooks, scripts, tests, docs) into plugins/dotnet-artisan/ via git mv. Created root marketplace.json following anthropics/claude-plugins-official canonical schema. Rewrote root README.md and CLAUDE.md as marketplace-level docs, created plugin-specific README.md and CLAUDE.md. Updated CONTRIBUTING.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, AGENTS.md with correct paths. Updated CHANGELOG.md. Validation scripts pass from plugin directory.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: d0f4113e13f54210a80cbacd193cbd6c24e29cf2\n- Tests: cd plugins/dotnet-artisan && ./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n- PRs:"

Remove dist generation steps. Implement per-plugin versioning with plugin-prefixed tags. Add root marketplace.json validation directly in CI.\n\n**Size:** S\n**Files:** `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`\n\n## Approach\n\n### validate.yml\n\n- **Root marketplace.json validation**: Validate root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` directly in the workflow \u2014 check JSON is valid and each plugin in the `plugins[]` array has a `source` path pointing to a directory containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is the only place root marketplace.json is validated (not in validate-marketplace.sh).\n- **Plugin-level JSON validation**: Validate `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugins/dotnet-artisan/hooks/hooks.json`, `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.mcp.json`\n- **Validate skills step**: `cd plugins/dotnet-artisan && ./scripts/validate-skills.sh`\n- **Validate marketplace step**: `cd plugins/dotnet-artisan && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` (validates per-plugin manifests only)\n- **Remove** \"Generate dist/ outputs\" and \"Validate cross-agent conformance\" steps entirely\n- **Job summary**: Keep description budget metrics, remove dist-related metrics\n\n### release.yml\n\n- **Trigger**: Change from `v*` to `dotnet-artisan/v*` tags\n- **Version extraction**: Parse version from `dotnet-artisan/v0.1.0` format\n- **Remove Pages deployment**: Drop `configure-pages`, `upload-pages-artifact`, `deploy-pages` steps and `pages` concurrency group\n- **Remove permissions**: Drop `pages: write` and `id-token: write` (only needed for Pages)\n- **Release body**: Update to reference plugin install command, not dist URLs\n- **Validation**: Run from plugin directory (same as validate.yml)\n\n### Per-plugin versioning\n\n- Version source of truth: `plugins/dotnet-artisan/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `version` field\n- Tag format: `dotnet-artisan/v0.1.0`\n- GitHub Release name: `dotnet-artisan v0.1.0`\n\n## Key Context\n\n- Current validate.yml at `.github/workflows/validate.yml:1-72`\n- Current release.yml at `.github/workflows/release.yml:1-97`\n- Both currently reference generate_dist.py and validate_cross_agent.py (deleted in Task 1)\n- Work happens on feature branch \u2014 intermediate CI failures on the branch are OK\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] validate.yml validates root marketplace.json (JSON valid + source paths resolve) directly in workflow\n- [ ] validate.yml validates plugin-level JSON files at new paths\n- [ ] validate.yml runs skill and marketplace validation from `plugins/dotnet-artisan/`\n- [ ] validate.yml has no references to generate_dist.py or validate_cross_agent.py\n- [ ] release.yml triggers on `dotnet-artisan/v*` tags\n- [ ] release.yml has no Pages deployment steps or pages permissions\n- [ ] release.yml creates GitHub Release with plugin install instructions in body\n- [ ] Both workflows pass on the restructured branch\n## Done summary\nUpdated CI workflows for marketplace structure: validate.yml now validates root marketplace.json (JSON valid + source paths resolve) and runs plugin validation from plugins/dotnet-artisan/; release.yml triggers on dotnet-artisan/v* tags with per-plugin versioning and plugin install instructions in release body, with all Pages deployment and dist generation steps removed.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 462a1465fc518ab2692ed83bd48656dede2d4f6f\n- Tests: cd plugins/dotnet-artisan && ./scripts/validate-skills.sh, cd plugins/dotnet-artisan && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh, jq empty .claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n- PRs:"

Minimal file \u2014 interface (display name, description) and policy fields.\n\n**Size:** S\n**Files:** `.agents/openai.yaml`\n\n## Approach\n\n- Create `.agents/openai.yaml` at the repo root with:\n  - `interface.display_name`: \"dotnet-artisan\"\n  - `interface.short_description`: the plugin description\n  - `policy.allow_implicit_invocation`: true\n- Verify the Codex openai.yaml schema before authoring \u2014 if the schema has changed or the URL is unavailable, use the pattern from existing repos (e.g., `anthropics/claude-plugins-official`)\n- This file is hand-authored and committed \u2014 no generation needed\n- This task has no dependencies and can be done in parallel with other tasks\n\n## Key Context\n\n- Codex reads `.agents/` at the repo root for skill discovery\n- The skills themselves live at `plugins/dotnet-artisan/skills/` \u2014 the openai.yaml provides top-level metadata only\n- This does NOT require moving or duplicating skills to `.agents/skills/`\n\n## Acceptance\n- [x] `.agents/openai.yaml` exists at repo root\n- [x] Contains valid, parseable YAML (verified by Ruby YAML parser)\n- [x] Contains `interface` and `policy` keys\n- [x] Display name and description match plugin metadata\n## Done summary\nCreated .agents/openai.yaml at repo root for Codex discovery with interface (display_name, short_description matching plugin.json) and policy (allow_implicit_invocation: true) fields.\n## Task\nCreate `.agents/openai.yaml` at repo root for Codex plugin discovery.\n\n## Review Summary\nConducted John Carmack-level specification review using RepoPrompt backend.\n\n### Initial Review Verdict: NEEDS_WORK\n- Critical: Schema authenticity unverified\n- Major (2): File location concerns, no CI validation\n- Minor (3): Description drift, weak criteria, missing refs\n- Nitpick (2): dependencies.tools clarity, directory creation\n\n### Re-Review Findings\nReviewer downgraded critical to major (mitigated by pragmatic fallback). File location and task refs addressed in spec. Schema concern acceptable with documentation.\n\n**Final Verdict: SHIP**\n\n### Recommended Actions Before Implementation\n1. Add YAML comment noting schema source is community convention\n2. Create `.agents/` directory explicitly (not just openai.yaml file)\n3. File follow-up to add CI validation to validate.yml\n\n## Review Process\n- Backend: RepoPrompt\n- Initial prompt: Specification review with schema validation focus\n- Re-review: Addressed findings and clarifications\n- Files reviewed: Task spec, plugin.json, CLAUDE.md, sibling task .3\n\n## Outcome\nTask spec is SHIP-ready for implementation. One follow-up task recommended (CI validation integration).\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests: ruby -ryaml -e YAML.safe_load(File.read(.agents/openai.yaml))\n- PRs:"
