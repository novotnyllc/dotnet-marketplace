    "spec": "# fn-17: CLI Tool Development Skills\n\n## Overview\nDelivers comprehensive CLI tool development skills covering System.CommandLine API, CLI application architecture patterns (clig.dev), distribution strategy (Native AOT, dotnet tool, single-file), multi-platform packaging (Homebrew, apt/deb, winget, Scoop, Chocolatey), and unified release pipelines. These are **CLI-focused** skills that teach how to build, distribute, and maintain .NET CLI tools. General AOT compilation lives in fn-16; general CI/CD patterns in fn-19; project scaffolding in fn-4.\n\n## Scope\n**Skills (5 total):**\n- `dotnet-system-commandline` \u2014 System.CommandLine 2.0 API: RootCommand, Command, Option<T>, Argument<T>, middleware pipeline, hosting integration (`UseCommandHandler`), tab completion, `--version`/`--help` auto-generation, dependency injection, `IConsole` abstraction\n- `dotnet-cli-architecture` \u2014 Layered CLI design patterns (clig.dev): command \u2192 handler \u2192 service architecture, configuration precedence (appsettings + env vars + CLI args), structured logging in CLI context, exit code conventions, stdin/stdout/stderr patterns, testing CLI apps (in-process invocation, output assertion)\n- `dotnet-cli-distribution` \u2014 CLI distribution strategy: Native AOT single-file publish for CLI tools, RID matrix (linux-x64, osx-arm64, win-x64, linux-arm64), self-contained vs framework-dependent trade-offs, `dotnet tool` packaging as alternative, size optimization for CLI binaries\n- `dotnet-cli-packaging` \u2014 Multi-platform packaging: Homebrew formula (binary tap, cask), apt/deb (dpkg-deb), winget manifest (YAML schema, PR to winget-pkgs), Scoop manifest, Chocolatey, `dotnet tool` global/local, NuGet distribution\n- `dotnet-cli-release-pipeline` \u2014 Unified release CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow producing all formats from single trigger, build matrix per RID, artifact staging, GitHub Releases with checksums, automated formula/manifest PR creation, versioning (SemVer + git tags)\n\n**Naming convention:** All skills use `dotnet-` prefix. `dotnet-system-commandline` uses library name (only library in this space). Others use descriptive noun style.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Hard epic dependencies:**\n- fn-16 (Native AOT): `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` and `[skill:dotnet-aot-architecture]` must exist for cross-refs in distribution skill\n\n**Soft epic dependencies:**\n- fn-5 (Architecture): `[skill:dotnet-containers]` for container distribution context \u2014 already shipped\n- fn-4 (Project Structure): `[skill:dotnet-scaffold-project]` for project scaffolding cross-refs \u2014 already shipped\n- fn-19 (CI/CD): Scope boundary \u2014 fn-17 owns CLI-specific release pipeline; fn-19 owns general CI/CD patterns\n- fn-7 (Testing): `[skill:dotnet-testing-strategy]` for CLI testing cross-refs \u2014 deferred placeholder if not shipped\n\n## .NET Version Policy\n\n**Baseline:** .NET 8.0+\n\n| Component | Version | Notes |\n|-----------|---------|-------|\n| System.CommandLine | 2.0.0-beta4 | Pre-release NuGet package; API surface stable (used by `dotnet` CLI itself) |\n| Native AOT for CLI | .NET 8+ | Console app AOT since .NET 7; full support .NET 8+ |\n| dotnet tool packaging | .NET 8+ | Global/local tools |\n| Single-file publish | .NET 8+ | Mature; recommended for CLI distribution |\n\n**Note:** System.CommandLine 2.0's beta status must be documented with production readiness assessment. The API is stable and battle-tested (powers the `dotnet` CLI), but the NuGet package version remains pre-release.\n\n## Conventions\n\n- **Frontmatter:** Required fields are `name` and `description` only\n- **Cross-reference syntax:** `[skill:skill-name]` for all skill references\n- **Description budget:** Target < 120 characters per skill description\n- **Out-of-scope format:** \"**Out of scope:**\" paragraph with epic ownership attribution\n- **Code examples:** Use `.NET 8.0+` TFM unless demonstrating version-specific features\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n\n| Concern | fn-17 owns | Other epic owns | Enforcement |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Native AOT compilation | CLI-specific AOT publish (RID matrix, single-file, when to choose AOT) | fn-16: general AOT pipeline, trimming, ILLink, MSBuild properties | Cross-ref to `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]`; no re-teaching AOT MSBuild |\n| CI/CD | CLI-specific release pipeline (build\u2192package\u2192release) | fn-19: general CI/CD patterns, matrix builds, deploy pipelines | Scope boundary statement; fn-17 focuses on CLI artifact pipeline |\n| Project scaffolding | CLI project structure patterns | fn-4: general scaffolding | Cross-ref to `[skill:dotnet-scaffold-project]` |\n| Container distribution | CLI in container context only (brief mention) | fn-5: general container patterns (`[skill:dotnet-containers]`) | Cross-ref; no re-teaching container patterns |\n| Testing CLI apps | CLI-specific testing (process invocation, output assertion, System.CommandLine.Testing) | fn-7: general testing strategies | Cross-ref to fn-7 skills; deferred placeholder if not shipped |\n| DI in CLI context | CLI hosting + DI integration | fn-3: general DI patterns (`[skill:dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection]`) | Cross-ref; no re-teaching DI |\n\n## Cross-Reference Classification\n\n| Target Skill | Type | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` | Hard | AOT publish for CLI distribution |\n| `[skill:dotnet-aot-architecture]` | Hard | AOT-safe patterns for CLI tools |\n| `[skill:dotnet-containers]` | Soft | Container-based CLI distribution |\n| `[skill:dotnet-scaffold-project]` | Soft | CLI project scaffolding |\n| `[skill:dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection]` | Soft | DI in CLI hosting context |\n| `[skill:dotnet-testing-strategy]` | Soft | CLI testing cross-ref (deferred) |\n\n## Task Decomposition\n\n### fn-17.1: Create System.CommandLine and CLI architecture skills (no dependencies)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-system-commandline`, `dotnet-cli-architecture`\n- `skills/cli-tools/dotnet-system-commandline/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/cli-tools/dotnet-cli-architecture/SKILL.md`\n- Both require `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- `dotnet-system-commandline` covers: RootCommand, Command, Option<T>, Argument<T>, middleware, hosting integration, tab completion, auto-generated help/version, DI, IConsole, beta status assessment\n- `dotnet-cli-architecture` covers: clig.dev principles, layered architecture, configuration precedence, logging, exit codes, stdin/stdout/stderr, testing CLI apps\n- Each skill must contain out-of-scope boundary statements\n- Does NOT modify `plugin.json` (handled by fn-17.3)\n\n### fn-17.2: Create distribution, packaging, and release pipeline skills (depends on fn-17.1, fn-16.1)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-cli-distribution`, `dotnet-cli-packaging`, `dotnet-cli-release-pipeline`\n- `skills/cli-tools/dotnet-cli-distribution/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/cli-tools/dotnet-cli-packaging/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/cli-tools/dotnet-cli-release-pipeline/SKILL.md`\n- `dotnet-cli-distribution` covers: when to choose AOT vs framework-dependent vs dotnet tool, RID matrix strategy, single-file publish, size optimization for CLI binaries \u2014 cross-refs `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` for AOT MSBuild\n- `dotnet-cli-packaging` covers: Homebrew formula (binary tap, cask), apt/deb packaging, winget manifest, Scoop, Chocolatey, dotnet tool global/local, NuGet\n- `dotnet-cli-release-pipeline` covers: unified GitHub Actions workflow, build matrix per RID, artifact staging, GitHub Releases with checksums, automated formula/manifest PRs, SemVer + git tags\n- Each skill must contain out-of-scope boundary statements\n- **Depends on fn-17.1** (architecture patterns context for distribution)\n- **Depends on fn-16.1** (`[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` must exist for hard cross-refs)\n- Does NOT modify `plugin.json` (handled by fn-17.3)\n\n### fn-17.3: Integration \u2014 plugin registration, validation, and cross-reference audit (depends on fn-17.1, fn-17.2)\n**Delivers:** Plugin registration and validation for all 5 skills\n- Registers all 5 skill paths in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n- Runs repo-wide uniqueness check on skill `name` frontmatter\n- Runs `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`\n- Validates cross-references use canonical skill IDs and resolve to existing skills\n- Validates scope boundary statements present in each skill\n- Updates existing `<!-- TODO(fn-17) -->` placeholders in other skills (check `dotnet-native-aot` for CLI cross-ref placeholder)\n- Validates soft cross-refs noted but not enforced\n- Single owner of `plugin.json` modifications\n\n**Execution order:** fn-17.1 \u2192 fn-17.2 \u2192 fn-17.3 (serial; fn-17.1 and fn-17.2 are file-disjoint but fn-17.2 has logical dependency on fn-17.1 for cross-ref consistency)\n\n## Key Context\n- System.CommandLine is the modern standard for .NET CLI apps (not CommandLineParser, Spectre.Console.Cli, or Cocona)\n- System.CommandLine 2.0 is pre-release but battle-tested (powers the `dotnet` CLI itself)\n- CLI apps benefit significantly from Native AOT (fast startup, no runtime dependency, smaller binary)\n- clig.dev provides language-agnostic CLI design principles (exit codes, stderr for diagnostics, stdout for data, machine-readable output)\n- Unified CI/CD pipeline maximizes maintainability across package manager formats\n- Homebrew is primary for macOS, apt/deb for Debian/Ubuntu, winget for Windows 10+, Scoop for Windows power users\n- `dotnet tool` packaging is the simplest distribution but requires .NET runtime on target\n- Native AOT + single-file is the gold standard for CLI distribution (zero dependencies on target)\n\n## Quick Commands\n```bash\n# Validate all 5 skills exist with frontmatter\nfor s in dotnet-system-commandline dotnet-cli-architecture dotnet-cli-distribution dotnet-cli-packaging dotnet-cli-release-pipeline; do\n  test -f \"skills/cli-tools/$s/SKILL.md\" && echo \"OK: $s\" || echo \"MISSING: $s\"\ndone\n\n# Validate frontmatter has required fields (name AND description)\nfor s in skills/cli-tools/*/SKILL.md;

All 5 skills exist at `skills/cli-tools/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter\n2. `dotnet-system-commandline` covers full System.CommandLine 2.0 API: RootCommand, Command, Option<T>, Argument<T>, middleware pipeline, hosting integration, tab completion, auto-generated help/version\n3. `dotnet-system-commandline` documents System.CommandLine 2.0 beta status with production readiness assessment\n4. `dotnet-cli-architecture` covers clig.dev principles: layered command \u2192 handler \u2192 service architecture, configuration precedence, structured logging, exit code conventions, stdin/stdout/stderr patterns\n5. `dotnet-cli-architecture` covers CLI testing: in-process invocation via `CommandLineBuilder`, stdout/stderr capture, exit code assertion\n6. `dotnet-cli-distribution` covers distribution strategy: when to choose Native AOT vs framework-dependent vs `dotnet tool`, RID matrix, single-file publish, size optimization\n7. `dotnet-cli-distribution` cross-references `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` \u2014 does not re-teach AOT MSBuild configuration\n8. `dotnet-cli-packaging` covers all major formats: Homebrew formula, apt/deb, winget manifest, Scoop, Chocolatey, `dotnet tool` global/local, NuGet\n9. `dotnet-cli-release-pipeline` covers unified GitHub Actions workflow producing all formats from single trigger with build matrix, artifact staging, GitHub Releases with checksums\n10. `dotnet-cli-release-pipeline` cross-references fn-19 CI/CD skills with scope boundary \u2014 does not re-teach general CI patterns\n11. Skills cross-reference fn-16 AOT skills, fn-5 container skills, fn-3 DI skills using canonical skill IDs \u2014 not re-teach\n12. Each skill contains explicit out-of-scope boundary statements for related epics (fn-16 AOT, fn-19 CI/CD, fn-3 DI, fn-7 testing)\n13. All 5 skills registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (fn-17.3)\n14. `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes for all 5 skills\n15. Skill `name` frontmatter values are unique repo-wide\n16.
