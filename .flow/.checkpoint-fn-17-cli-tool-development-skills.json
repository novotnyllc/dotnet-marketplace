    "spec": "# fn-17: CLI Tool Development Skills\n\n## Problem/Goal\nAdd comprehensive CLI tool development skills covering System.CommandLine, architecture patterns (avoiding \"one big bash script\"), Native AOT distribution, and multi-platform package manager publishing (Homebrew, apt, winget).\n\n## Acceptance Checks\n- [ ] `dotnet-system-commandline` skill covers full System.CommandLine API (commands, options, arguments, middleware, hosting, tab completion)\n- [ ] `dotnet-cli-architecture` skill covers layered CLI design patterns (reference: clig.dev) for maintainability\n- [ ] `dotnet-cli-aot-distribution` skill covers Native AOT for CLI tools plus cross-platform distribution\n- [ ] `dotnet-cli-homebrew`, `dotnet-cli-apt`, `dotnet-cli-winget` skills cover platform-specific packaging + CI/CD\n- [ ] `dotnet-cli-unified-pipeline` skill covers unified CI/CD producing all package formats from single build\n- [ ] Cross-references to dotnet-native-aot, CI/CD skills\n\n## Key Context\n- System.CommandLine is the modern standard (not CommandLineParser)\n- CLI apps benefit significantly from Native AOT (fast startup, no runtime dependency)\n- clig.dev principles for good CLI design\n- Unified CI/CD pipeline maximizes maintainability across package managers\n"
