    "spec": "# Skill Coverage Gap Fill\n\n## Overview\nAdd identified missing skills from the gap analysis. Covers messaging/event-driven, System.IO.Pipelines, DDD/domain modeling, structured logging, LINQ optimization, GC/memory management, .NET Aspire patterns, and Semantic Kernel AI integration. These represent the coverage gaps not addressed by existing epics (fn-30 through fn-37).\n\n**Note:** The original gap analysis identified middleware authoring as a gap, but review confirmed that the existing `dotnet-middleware-patterns` skill already covers IMiddleware vs convention-based, pipeline ordering, Map/MapWhen/UseWhen branching, body buffering, short-circuit, and exception handling comprehensively. That skill is dropped from this epic. The count is 8 new skills.\n\n**Budget note:** Currently at ~12,458/15,000 chars with 113 skills. This epic adds 8 skills (~960 chars for descriptions at ~120 chars each). Projected total: ~13,418/15,000 chars. Target new skill descriptions at ~100 chars where possible to maintain headroom. Task fn-39.3 will validate actual budget and slim descriptions across ALL skills if needed.\n\n## Scope\n\n### New Skills (8 total)\n1. **dotnet-messaging-patterns** (`skills/architecture/`) \u2014 Durable messaging: pub/sub, competing consumers, dead-letter queues, saga patterns, delivery guarantees. Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, MassTransit.\n2. **dotnet-io-pipelines** (`skills/core-csharp/`) \u2014 System.IO.Pipelines: PipeReader/PipeWriter, backpressure, protocol parsing, Kestrel integration. Toub-grounded.\n3. **dotnet-domain-modeling** (`skills/architecture/`) \u2014 DDD tactical patterns: aggregates, value objects, domain events, repository with EF Core/Dapper, rich vs anemic models.\n4. **dotnet-structured-logging** (`skills/architecture/`) \u2014 Log pipeline design: aggregation architecture (ELK/Seq), structured query patterns, log sampling strategies, PII scrubbing/destructuring, cross-service correlation. **Distinct from** `dotnet-observability` which owns Serilog/MEL basics, source-generated LoggerMessage, enrichers, single-service scopes, and OTel logging export. This skill covers what happens _after_ log emission.\n5. **dotnet-linq-optimization** (`skills/core-csharp/`) \u2014 IQueryable vs IEnumerable, compiled queries, deferred execution pitfalls, allocation patterns, Span alternatives.\n6. **dotnet-gc-memory** (`skills/performance/`) \u2014 GC modes, LOH/POH, Gen0/1/2 tuning, Span/Memory deep patterns, ArrayPool/MemoryPool, memory profiling. Toub-grounded.\n7. **dotnet-aspire-patterns** (`skills/architecture/`) \u2014 .NET Aspire orchestration: AppHost, service discovery, component model, dashboard, health checks. Distinct from container skills.\n8. **dotnet-semantic-kernel** (`skills/ai/`) \u2014 Semantic Kernel for AI/LLM orchestration: kernel setup, plugins, prompt templates, memory/vector stores, agents. Placed under `ai/` category as a domain-specific capability distinct from architecture patterns.\n\n### Dropped from original plan\n- **dotnet-middleware-authoring** \u2014 Existing `dotnet-middleware-patterns` skill already covers all planned content (IMiddleware vs RequestDelegate, pipeline ordering/branching, body buffering, endpoint routing). No new skill needed.\n\n## Design Constraints\n- Each skill description under 120 characters (target ~100 chars for budget headroom)\n- Follow existing SKILL.md frontmatter pattern (name, description only)\n- Use `[skill:skill-name]` cross-reference syntax\n- All package version references use latest stable\n- No fn-N spec references in content\n- Skills must be self-contained\n- SKILL.md content under 5,000 words per CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md\n- Register all new skills in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n- If total budget exceeds 15,000 chars, slim descriptions across ALL skills (not just new ones)\n\n## Quick commands\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\npython3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict\npython3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] All 8 new skills created with valid SKILL.md frontmatter\n- [ ] All 8 skills registered in plugin.json\n- [ ] All cross-references valid\n- [ ] Description budget within 15,000 chars (or descriptions slimmed to fit)\n- [ ] No fn-N spec references in any content\n- [ ] All SKILL.md files under 5,000 words\n- [ ] All four validation commands pass\n\n## References\n- Stephen Toub IO.Pipelines: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/system-io-pipelines-high-performance-io-in-net/\n- MassTransit: https://masstransit.io/\n- Azure Service Bus patterns: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/\n- Microsoft Semantic Kernel: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/\n- .NET Aspire: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/\n"

This skill covers what happens _after_ log emission \u2014 the pipeline, query, and operations layer.\n2. **dotnet-linq-optimization** (`skills/core-csharp/dotnet-linq-optimization/SKILL.md`) \u2014 LINQ performance patterns: IQueryable vs IEnumerable materialization, compiled queries for EF Core, deferred execution pitfalls, LINQ-to-Objects allocation patterns, when to drop to manual loops, Span-based alternatives.\n3. **dotnet-gc-memory** (`skills/performance/dotnet-gc-memory/SKILL.md`) \u2014 GC and memory management: GC modes (workstation vs server), LOH/POH, Gen0/1/2 tuning, memory pressure, Span<T>/Memory<T> deep patterns beyond basics, ArrayPool/MemoryPool, weak references, finalizers vs IDisposable, memory profiling with dotMemory/PerfView.\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** `skills/architecture/dotnet-structured-logging/SKILL.md`, `skills/core-csharp/dotnet-linq-optimization/SKILL.md`, `skills/performance/dotnet-gc-memory/SKILL.md`\n\n## Approach\n- Follow existing SKILL.md frontmatter pattern (name, description only)\n- Each description under 120 characters (target ~100 chars for budget headroom)\n- dotnet-structured-logging cross-refs: `[skill:dotnet-observability]`, `[skill:dotnet-csharp-configuration]`\n  - **Scope boundary:** This skill covers log pipeline/operations/queries. `dotnet-observability` covers log emission (MEL, Serilog, enrichers, sinks, OTel export). Add an explicit \"Out of scope\" section referencing `dotnet-observability` for emission topics.\n- dotnet-linq-optimization cross-refs: `[skill:dotnet-efcore-patterns]`, `[skill:dotnet-performance-patterns]`\n- dotnet-gc-memory cross-refs: `[skill:dotnet-performance-patterns]`, `[skill:dotnet-profiling]`, `[skill:dotnet-channels]`\n- dotnet-gc-memory should reference Toub's GC/performance blog posts as knowledge source\n- No fn-N spec references, latest stable package versions\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] dotnet-structured-logging SKILL.md created with frontmatter\n- [ ] Covers log aggregation architecture, structured queries, sampling, PII scrubbing, cross-service correlation\n- [ ] Has explicit \"Out of scope\" section referencing `dotnet-observability` for emission topics\n- [ ] Distinct from dotnet-observability (no content overlap \u2014 pipeline/ops vs emission)\n- [ ] dotnet-linq-optimization SKILL.md created with frontmatter\n- [ ] Covers IQueryable vs IEnumerable, compiled queries, allocation patterns\n- [ ] dotnet-gc-memory SKILL.md created with frontmatter\n- [ ] Covers GC modes, LOH/POH, Span/Memory deep patterns, memory profiling\n- [ ] All cross-references use `[skill:...]` syntax\n- [ ] All descriptions under 120 characters\n- [ ] All SKILL.md files under 5,000 words\n- [ ] No fn-N spec references\n## Done summary\nCreated three new skills: dotnet-structured-logging (log pipeline design covering aggregation architecture, structured queries, sampling, PII scrubbing, cross-service correlation), dotnet-linq-optimization (LINQ performance patterns covering IQueryable vs IEnumerable, compiled queries, deferred execution, allocation patterns), and dotnet-gc-memory (GC and memory management covering GC modes, LOH/POH, generational tuning, Span/Memory ownership, ArrayPool/MemoryPool, memory profiling).\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 3fee63dfee3e8e5e2e62f6ee5a2e6fe94fa3e399, 963bb2d97bae3b395a69921a79ca1d708a2c8144\n- Tests: ./scripts/validate-skills.sh, ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh, python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict, python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py\n- PRs:"
