    "spec": "# fn-43 Add File-Based Apps Skill for .NET 10 SDK\n\n## Overview\n\nAdd a new `dotnet-file-based-apps` skill covering the .NET 10 SDK feature that allows running C# files directly without a project file (`dotnet run app.cs`). Covers `#:package`, `#:sdk`, `#:property`, and `#:project` directives.\n\n**Visibility:** Implicit \u2014 auto-loaded by agents via advisor routing when a .NET 10 file-based app context is detected. Not user-invocable.\n\n## Scope\n\n**In:** SKILL.md for `dotnet-file-based-apps` under `skills/foundation/`, plugin.json registration, advisor routing, cross-references from `dotnet-version-detection` and `dotnet-project-analysis`.\n\n**Out:** Modifying version detection logic itself (separate concern). File I/O (`dotnet-file-io` is a different skill \u2014 covers FileStream/RandomAccess, not file-based apps).\n\n**Scope boundary with `dotnet-project-analysis`**: Project analysis detects `.csproj`/`.sln`. File-based apps have NO project file. Add a cross-reference note, not detection logic.\n\n**Scope boundary with `dotnet-scaffold-project`**: Scaffold stays focused on csproj-based projects.\n\n## Key Context\n\n- .NET 10 SDK feature: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk/file-based-apps\n- Directives: `#:package <name>[@version]`, `#:sdk <name>`, `#:property <name>=<value>`, `#:project <path>`\n- No `.csproj` means `dotnet build`/`dotnet test` do not apply in the traditional sense\n- Agent must recognize `#:` directives as SDK-level, not C# syntax\n- Description should explicitly differentiate from `dotnet-file-io` \u2014 avoid the word \"file I/O\"\n- Budget: plugin.json currently has 127 skill entries. Adding this skill \u2192 128. Target description ~90 chars.\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] `skills/foundation/dotnet-file-based-apps/SKILL.md` exists with valid frontmatter\n- [ ] Covers all four directive types with usage guidance\n- [ ] Covers migration path from file-based to project-based\n- [ ] Description under 120 characters, explicitly differentiates from dotnet-file-io\n- [ ] Registered in plugin.json\n- [ ] `dotnet-advisor` routing updated (Routing Logic section)\n- [ ] Cross-references added to/from `dotnet-version-detection` and `dotnet-project-analysis`\n- [ ] All validation scripts pass\n- [ ] Integration task notes file contention with plugin.json/advisor shared files\n\n## References\n\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk/file-based-apps\n- `skills/foundation/dotnet-version-detection/SKILL.md` (version gating: .NET 10+ only)\n- `skills/foundation/dotnet-project-analysis/SKILL.md` (scope boundary)\n- `skills/foundation/dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md` \u2014 Routing Logic section\n"
