    "spec": "# fn-29: Fleet Skill Review and Improvement Sweep\n\n## Overview\n\nDeploy a fleet of parallel worker agents to review all 99 skills in dotnet-artisan against best practices from Anthropic's skill authoring guide and this repo's conventions. Each agent reviews a batch of skills by category, produces a findings report, and then implements approved improvements. A coordinator task merges findings and resolves cross-cutting issues.\n\n## Approach\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Audit:** Parallel agents each review a batch of skill categories. Each agent evaluates every SKILL.md in its assigned categories against the review rubric (below) and produces a structured findings report.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Implement:** After audit findings are consolidated, parallel agents implement improvements within their assigned categories. Changes are committed per-category for clean review.\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Validate:** Run all four validation commands, verify context budget, and ensure cross-references are intact.\n\n### Review Rubric (per skill)\n\nEach skill is evaluated on these dimensions:\n\n1. **Description Quality** \u2014 Does it follow the formula: `[What it does] + [When to use it]`? Is it under 120 chars? Does it include trigger phrases a user would actually say?\n2. **Description Triggering** \u2014 Would Claude correctly trigger this skill from typical user requests? Any over/under-triggering risks?\n3. **Instruction Clarity** \u2014 Are instructions specific and actionable (not vague)? Are critical steps explicit?\n4. **Progressive Disclosure** \u2014 Is SKILL.md focused on core instructions? Are detailed references linked rather than inlined? Is it under 5,000 words?\n5. **Cross-References** \u2014 Does it use `[skill:name]` syntax for all skill references? Are cross-references accurate and pointing to existing skills? Are bidirectional references present where appropriate?\n6. **Error Handling** \u2014 Does it include troubleshooting or common pitfalls for the .NET domain it covers?\n7. **Examples** \u2014 Does it include concrete examples showing the skill in action?\n8. **Composability** \u2014 Does it work well alongside other skills? Does it avoid assuming it's the only loaded skill?\n9. **Consistency** \u2014 Does it follow the same patterns as peer skills in its category (section headers, code example format, cross-ref placement, Agent Gotchas presence)?\n10. **Registration & Budget** \u2014 Is the skill registered in plugin.json? Is the description under 120 chars? What is the aggregate budget impact of any proposed description change?\n11. **Progressive Disclosure Compliance** \u2014 Does the skill use a `details.md` companion file if SKILL.md exceeds ~3,000 words or has extensive code examples? Is `details.md` properly referenced from the main SKILL.md?\n\n### Category Batches for Parallel Workers\n\nBatches are designed so each worker handles ~9-20 skills (99 total across 18 categories):\n\n- **Batch A (20 skills):** core-csharp (9), foundation (4), project-structure (6), release-management (1)\n- **Batch B (19 skills):** architecture (10), serialization (4), security (3), multi-targeting (2)\n- **Batch C (18 skills):** testing (10), cicd (8)\n- **Batch D (18 skills):** api-development (5), cli-tools (5), performance (4), native-aot (4)\n- **Batch E (17 skills):** ui-frameworks (13), agent-meta-skills (4)\n- **Batch F (9 skills):** documentation (5), packaging (3), localization (1)\n\n**Note:** Batch totals sum to 101 but actual plugin.json count is 99. Task 1 must reconcile by verifying against `jq '.skills | length' .claude-plugin/plugin.json` and adjusting batch assignments to match.\n\n## Scope\n\n### Task 1: Create Review Rubric and Coordination Plan\n\nProduce a `docs/fleet-review-rubric.md` that contains:\n- The evaluation rubric (11 dimensions above) with scoring guidance (pass/warn/fail per dimension)\n- Per-skill output template (structured markdown for findings)\n- Category batch assignments with verified skill counts (reconcile against plugin.json)\n- Instructions for worker agents (what to read, how to evaluate, what to output)\n\nThis task produces the coordination artifacts the fleet needs. No skill changes yet.\n\n### Task 2: Audit Batch A \u2014 Foundation & Core C# & Project Structure\n\nReview all skills in: core-csharp (9), foundation (4), project-structure (6), release-management (1).\nProduce findings report at `docs/review-reports/batch-a-findings.md`.\n\n### Task 3: Audit Batch B \u2014 Architecture & Serialization & Security\n\nReview all skills in: architecture (10), serialization (4), security (3), multi-targeting (2).\nProduce findings report at `docs/review-reports/batch-b-findings.md`.\n\n### Task 4: Audit Batch C \u2014 Testing & CI/CD\n\nReview all skills in: testing (10), cicd (8).\nProduce findings report at `docs/review-reports/batch-c-findings.md`.\n\n### Task 5: Audit Batch D \u2014 API & CLI & Performance & Native AOT\n\nReview all skills in: api-development (5), cli-tools (5), performance (4), native-aot (4).\nProduce findings report at `docs/review-reports/batch-d-findings.md`.\n\n### Task 6: Audit Batch E \u2014 UI Frameworks & Agent Meta-Skills\n\nReview all skills in: ui-frameworks (13), agent-meta-skills (4).\nProduce findings report at `docs/review-reports/batch-e-findings.md`.\n\n### Task 7: Audit Batch F \u2014 Documentation & Packaging & Localization\n\nReview all skills in: documentation (5), packaging (3), localization (1).\nProduce findings report at `docs/review-reports/batch-f-findings.md`.\n\n### Task 8: Consolidate Findings and Prioritize Changes\n\nMerge all batch findings into a single prioritized improvement plan at `docs/review-reports/consolidated-findings.md`. Identify:\n- Critical issues (broken cross-refs, missing descriptions, over-budget descriptions)\n- High-value improvements (better trigger phrases, clearer instructions)\n- Low-priority polish (formatting, minor wording)\n- Cross-cutting patterns (issues that affect many skills similarly)\n- Projected description budget impact: current total, proposed total, delta vs 12K warn / 15K fail thresholds\n\n### Task 9: Implement Improvements \u2014 Batches A+B\n\nApply all Critical and High-value improvements from consolidated findings to skills in Batches A and B. Commit per-category. Do not modify descriptions without verifying aggregate budget impact.\n\n**File ownership:** Modifies only `SKILL.md` and `details.md` files within assigned category directories. Does NOT modify plugin.json, AGENTS.md, or README.md (owned by task 12).\n\n**Validation gate:** Run `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` after all changes to catch regressions early.\n\n### Task 10: Implement Improvements \u2014 Batches C+D\n\nApply all Critical and High-value improvements from consolidated findings to skills in Batches C and D. Commit per-category. Do not modify descriptions without verifying aggregate budget impact.\n\n**File ownership:** Modifies only `SKILL.md` and `details.md` files within assigned category directories. Does NOT modify plugin.json, AGENTS.md, or README.md (owned by task 12).\n\n**Validation gate:** Run `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` after all changes to catch regressions early.\n\n### Task 11: Implement Improvements \u2014 Batches E+F\n\nApply all Critical and High-value improvements from consolidated findings to skills in Batches E and F. Commit per-category. Do not modify descriptions without verifying aggregate budget impact.\n\n**File ownership:** Modifies only `SKILL.md` and `details.md` files within assigned category directories. Does NOT modify plugin.json, AGENTS.md, or README.md (owned by task 12).\n\n**Validation gate:** Run `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` after all changes to catch regressions early.\n\n### Task 12: Final Validation and Context Budget Check\n\n**File ownership:** Sole owner of plugin.json, AGENTS.md, and README.md modifications.\n\n- Run all four validation commands\n- Check total context budget (all descriptions < 15,000 chars, warn at 12,000)\n- Verify all cross-references resolve to existing skills\n- Update plugin.json, AGENTS.md, README.md if any skills were added/removed/renamed\n- Clean up docs/review-reports/ (keep consolidated findings, archive batch reports)\n\n## Quick commands\n\n- `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`\n- `./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh`\n- `python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict`\n- `python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py`\n\n## Task Dependencies\n\n```\nTask 1 (rubric) \u2192 Tasks 2-7 (audit, parallel) \u2192 Task 8 (consolidation) \u2192 Tasks 9-11 (implement, parallel) \u2192 Task 12 (validation)\n```\n\n- Task 1: no dependencies (first task)\n- Tasks 2-7: each depends on task 1 (rubric must exist before auditing)\n- Task 8: depends on tasks 2-7 (consolidation requires all audit reports)\n- Tasks 9-11: each depends on task 8 (implementation requires prioritized findings); tasks 9-11 can run in parallel (disjoint file sets)\n- Task 12: depends on tasks 9-11 (validation requires all implementations)\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] All 99 skills reviewed against the 11-dimension rubric\n- [ ] Findings reports produced for all 6 batches\n- [ ] Consolidated improvement plan prioritized with budget impact projection\n- [ ] All Critical and High-value improvements implemented\n- [ ] All four validation commands pass\n- [ ] Total context budget within limits (< 15,000 chars, ideally < 12,000)\n- [ ] All cross-references valid\n- [ ] Clean git history with per-category commits\n- [ ] Shared file ownership enforced (plugin.json, AGENTS.md, README.md only modified in task 12)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- fn-28 (Skill Authoring How-To Manual) should complete first so the review rubric aligns with the documented conventions\n\n## References\n\n- CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md (produced by fn-28)\n- CLAUDE.md (repo conventions)\n- Anthropic's \"The Complete Guide to Building Skills for Claude\"\n- Agent Skills open standard: https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills\n"

Run all four validation commands, verify context budget stays under thresholds, check all cross-references resolve correctly, and update shared files (plugin.json, AGENTS.md, README.md) if any skills were added/removed/renamed during improvement implementation. Clean up review reports \u2014 keep consolidated-findings.md for reference, archive or remove individual batch-{a..f}-findings.md reports.\n\n**File ownership:** This task is the sole owner of modifications to `plugin.json`, `AGENTS.md`, and `README.md`. All shared-file updates (skill counts, routing index, catalog) happen here.\n\n### Files\n\n- **Validation:** `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`, `./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh`, `python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict`, `python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py`\n- **Shared files (sole owner):** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`\n- **Cleanup:** `docs/review-reports/batch-{a..f}-findings.md` (archive or remove), keep `docs/review-reports/consolidated-findings.md`\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes\n- [ ] `./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` passes\n- [ ] `python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict` passes\n- [ ] `python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py` passes\n- [ ] Total description budget < 15,000 chars (warn if > 12,000)\n- [ ] All `[skill:name]` cross-references resolve to existing skills\n- [ ] plugin.json skill count matches actual skill directories on disk\n- [ ] AGENTS.md skill counts updated if changed\n- [ ] Batch findings reports archived or removed; consolidated findings retained\n\n## Done summary\nRegistered 2 missing multi-targeting skills in plugin.json (99->101), trimmed 3 over-budget descriptions to under 120 chars, updated skill counts and categories across AGENTS.md/README.md/CLAUDE.md (97->101 skills, 18->19 categories, Core C# 7->9), removed 6 batch findings reports retaining consolidated-findings.md. All four validation commands pass; context budget at 11,349/15,000 chars.\n## Evidence\n- Commits: 03f1e2d5146052ea2dace31dac095044d9a27cec\n- Tests: ./scripts/validate-skills.sh, ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh, python3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict, python3 scripts/validate_cross_agent.py\n- PRs:"
