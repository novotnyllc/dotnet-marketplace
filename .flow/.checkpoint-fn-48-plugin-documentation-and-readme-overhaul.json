    "spec": "# fn-48 Plugin Documentation and README Overhaul\n\n## Overview\n\nOverhaul the plugin documentation. The README.md needs accurate installation instructions, correct skill/agent counts, and a complete overview of what the plugin provides. CONTRIBUTING.md and CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md should be reviewed for accuracy.\n\n## Scope\n\n**In:** README.md rewrite with installation instructions, accurate counts, skill category overview, agent list. Review CONTRIBUTING.md and CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md for accuracy.\n\n**Out:** Skill content changes (no SKILL.md edits). Plugin manifest changes.\n\n## Key Context\n\n- Current README says \"9 specialist agents\" but there are 14\n- Current README says \"122 skills\" but plugin.json has 127 entries \u2014 needs reconciliation\n- README should cover: what the plugin does, how to install, skill categories overview, agent overview, quick start\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] README.md has correct installation instructions\n- [ ] Skill count reconciled and accurate\n- [ ] Agent count accurate (14)\n- [ ] Skill category overview covers all 22 categories\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md reviewed for accuracy\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md reviewed for accuracy\n- [ ] All validation scripts pass\n\n## References\n\n- `README.md` (current state)\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`\n- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (authoritative skill/agent counts)\n"
