Reconcile skill/agent counts and rewrite README.md with installation instructions, accurate counts, and a complete overview. Review CONTRIBUTING.md and CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md for accuracy.\n\n**Dependencies:** Runs after fn-43 through fn-47 complete (needs accurate post-batch counts). Expected skill count: 132 (127 current + 5 new).\n\n## Scope\n\n**In:** README.md rewrite with installation instructions, accurate counts, skill category overview. Fix CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md counts. Review CONTRIBUTING.md and CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md for accuracy.\n\n**Out:** Skill content changes (no SKILL.md edits). Plugin manifest changes.\n\n## Key Context\n\n- Current README says \"9 specialist agents\" but there are 14\n- Current plugin.json has 127 skill entries but docs say \"122\" \u2014 5 skills added without doc updates\n- Post-batch count: 132 skills (127 + 5 new from fn-43-47), 14 agents\n- README should cover: what the plugin does, how to install, skill categories overview, agent overview\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] Skill count = 132 across plugin.json, README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md\n- [ ] Agent count = 14 across all documents\n- [ ] README agent table lists all 14 agents\n- [ ] README has installation instructions\n- [ ] README has skill category overview covering all 22 categories\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md and CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md reviewed for accuracy\n- [ ] `--projected-skills` in validate-skills.sh updated to 132\n- [ ] All validation scripts pass\n\n## References\n\n- `README.md` (current state)\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`\n- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (authoritative skill/agent counts)\n"
