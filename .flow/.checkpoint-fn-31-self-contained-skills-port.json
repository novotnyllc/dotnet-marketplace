    "spec": "# Self-Contained Skills Port\n\n## Overview\nThe spec references Aaronontheweb/dotnet-skills as reference material but the plugin must be fully self-contained. Port all relevant skills from dotnet-skills, adapting them to our standards (SKILL.md frontmatter, cross-reference syntax, description budget, no fn-N references). Credit original authors in each ported skill.\n\n## Scope\nSkills to port/adapt from dotnet-skills (not already covered by existing skills):\n- **System.CommandLine** (>= 2.0.0 only, not earlier betas) \u2014 CLI app patterns, command hierarchy, argument binding\n- **FluentValidation alternatives** \u2014 Minimize third-party deps; cover built-in DataAnnotations, IValidatableObject, IValidateOptions, MinimalApis.Extensions validation\n- **Logging/Observability** \u2014 Structured logging with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, OpenTelemetry patterns\n- **Middleware patterns** \u2014 ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline, request/response manipulation\n- **gRPC** \u2014 service definitions, client/server patterns, streaming, interceptors\n- **SignalR** \u2014 real-time communication patterns, hub design, client integration\n- **Architecture principles** \u2014 DRY, SRP, SOLID principles deeply engrained (reference: https://stormwild.github.io/blog/post/srp-mistakes-csharp-dotnet/), clean architecture, vertical slices\n\n**Budget constraint**: Currently at 12,458/15,000 chars with 101 skills. Each new skill description must stay under 120 chars. Prefer extending existing skills over creating new ones where overlap exists.\n\n**Key rule**: Skills must never reference internal spec IDs (fn-N). No mention of implementation tracking.\n\n**Package version policy**: Always use latest stable versions of libraries. If existing reference is a prerelease, update to latest prerelease; if a higher stable exists, prefer stable.\n\n## Quick commands\n```bash\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\npython3 scripts/generate_dist.py --strict\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] All ported skills have SKILL.md with required frontmatter (name, description)\n- [ ] Original author credited in each ported skill (attribution section or note)\n- [ ] System.CommandLine skill covers >= 2.0.0 only\n- [ ] Built-in validation patterns preferred over FluentValidation\n- [ ] Architecture skill engrain SOLID/DRY/SRP with concrete C# anti-patterns and fixes\n- [ ] No fn-N spec references in any skill content\n- [ ] Description budget remains under 15,000 chars total\n- [ ] All skills registered in plugin.json\n- [ ] Cross-references use `[skill:name]` syntax\n- [ ] All validation commands pass\n\n## References\n- Aaronontheweb/dotnet-skills \u2014 source material (MIT license)\n- https://stormwild.github.io/blog/post/srp-mistakes-csharp-dotnet/ \u2014 SRP anti-patterns reference\n- `skills/` \u2014 existing skill structure to follow\n- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` \u2014 skill registration\n"
