# fn-48-plugin-documentation-and-readme-overhaul.2 Rewrite README.md with installation, overview, and complete skill catalog

## Description
Rewrite README.md with clear installation instructions, a complete skill category overview (all 22 categories), agent overview, and quick start guide.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`

## Approach

- Add installation section with clear instructions
- Add skill category overview table (22 categories with skill counts per category)
- Add complete agent table (all 14 agents)
- Add quick start / getting started section
- Review CONTRIBUTING.md and CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md for accuracy
- Keep prose concise — README is a reference, not a tutorial

## Key context

- Current install: Claude Desktop → Plugin tab → search or `/plugin add novotnyllc/dotnet-marketplace`
- README should serve both discovery (what does this plugin do?) and setup (how do I start?)
## Acceptance
- [ ] README has clear installation instructions
- [ ] README has skill category overview covering all 22 categories
- [ ] README has agent overview with all 14 agents
- [ ] README has quick start section
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md reviewed and paths correct
