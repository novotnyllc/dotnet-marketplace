    "spec": "# Consolidate 131 Skills into ~20 Broad Skills\n\n## Overview\n\nThe plugin has 131 individual skills consuming 75% of the 15,600-char routing description budget. Research shows Tier 1 plugin repos converge on 5-16 skills. RAG-MCP research shows routing accuracy drops from 43% to 13% with many tools. This epic consolidates 131 skills into ~20 broad skills with companion files for depth, improving routing accuracy while preserving all content.\n\nEach consolidated skill gets:\n- **SKILL.md** (auto-loaded on activation): overview, routing table, scope/out-of-scope, ToC pointing to companion files (~2-5KB)\n- **references/** directory: topic-named companion files with deep content from merged source skills (read on demand)\n\n## Scope\n\n- Consolidate all 131 skill directories into ~20 new skill directories\n- Create companion `references/` files preserving all source skill content\n- Rewrite `dotnet-advisor` routing catalog for ~20 skills\n- Update all 14 agent preloaded skill references\n- Update hooks, CI gates, validators\n- Delete complex eval harness (`tests/evals/`) \u2014 replace with structural validators only\n- Simplify copilot smoke tests for ~20 skills\n- Update all documentation for new skill count\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Redirect stubs for old skill names (no external consumers)\n- New skill content (consolidation only, not enhancement)\n- Agent restructuring (agents stay as-is, just update references)\n- New eval framework (structural validators are sufficient)\n\n## Key decisions\n\n1. **dotnet-advisor survives** \u2014 hooks inject it as mandatory first action; rewrite routing catalog for ~20 skills\n2. **Big-bang migration** \u2014 CI count gates (`EXPECTED=131`, `--projected-skills 131`) prevent incremental approach\n3. **Framework testing \u2192 UI framework groups** \u2014 `dotnet-blazor-testing` \u2192 `dotnet-blazor`, etc. (agents preload what they need)\n4. **Companion file convention** \u2014 `references/` directory with topic-named `.md` files (spec-standard pattern)\n5. **SKILL.md includes explicit ToC** \u2014 directs model to read specific companion files on demand\n6. **debugging stays standalone** \u2014 user requirement\n7. **Delete eval harness, keep structural validators** \u2014 the 8,100-line Python eval harness (tests/evals/) never ran in CI, costs real money, and all data is keyed to old 131-skill names. Structural validators (`validate-skills.sh`, `validate-marketplace.sh`, `validate-similarity.py`) catch the top bug classes (broken cross-refs, name mismatches, budget overflow, near-duplicates) deterministically in <5 seconds. With ~20 skills, routing confusion drops dramatically (RAG-MCP research), making LLM-based activation evals low-value.\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n# Validate after changes\nSTRICT_REFS=1 ./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] ~20 consolidated skill directories replace 131 individual directories\n- [ ] All source skill content preserved in SKILL.md + references/ companion files\n- [ ] All 14 agents updated with correct [skill:new-name] references\n- [ ] dotnet-advisor rewritten for ~20 skills\n- [ ] Hooks reference valid skill names\n- [ ] CI gates updated (EXPECTED count, --projected-skills)\n- [ ] `tests/evals/` directory deleted (eval harness removed)\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh && validate-marketplace.sh` both pass\n- [ ] Similarity baseline regenerated for ~20 skills\n- [ ] Copilot smoke tests remapped for ~20 skills\n- [ ] Description budget under 50% (currently 75%)\n- [ ] README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md updated with correct skill count\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- fn-56 (flat layout) \u2014 DONE, established current structure\n- fn-51 (frontmatter schema) \u2014 DONE, all skills have proper frontmatter\n- fn-53 (routing language) \u2014 DONE, descriptions follow Action+Domain+Differentiator\n- fn-55 (invocation contracts) \u2014 DONE, user-invocable field on all skills\n- fn-58/fn-60/fn-62/fn-63 (eval framework) \u2014 DONE, but eval harness being deleted as too complex; structural validators survive\n\n## References\n\n- Agent-skills spec: agentskills.io (only SKILL.md auto-loads; companion files need explicit reads)\n- Research: BiasBusters (description wording > names), RAG-MCP (accuracy drops with many tools)\n- Tier 1 repos: anthropics/skills (16), vercel-labs (6), kepano/obsidian (5)\n- Companion file patterns: anthropics/skills PDF skill (reference.md, forms.md), Vercel rules/ with atomic files\n- OpenAI eval-skills guide: deterministic checks catch most real bugs; LLM evals are research tools, not CI gates\n- anthropics/claude-plugins-official: TypeScript frontmatter validator in CI \u2014 minimal, effective\n- corca-ai/claude-plugins: bash test harness pattern (pass/fail/assert_eq) \u2014 lightweight smoke testing\n"

Delete eval harness**\n- Delete `tests/evals/` entirely (all runners, datasets, rubrics, baselines, results, config, requirements.txt)\n- This removes ~8,100 lines of Python, ~9.6MB of results/generations cache, and eliminates PyYAML eval dependency\n- Git history preserves all code if ever needed\n\n**2. Update CI gates**\n- `validate.yml` line 213: change `EXPECTED=131` to actual consolidated count\n- `validate-skills.sh`: update `--projected-skills` argument\n- `validate.yml` copilot-smoke job (lines 287-433): update hardcoded `--case-id` filter to reference new case IDs\n- Ensure `STRICT_REFS=1` is the default in CI (catches broken cross-refs post-consolidation)\n\n**3. Remap smoke tests**\n- `tests/copilot-smoke/cases.jsonl`: remap all `expected_skill` fields from old to new skill names, reduce to ~10-15 representative cases (1 per consolidated skill + negative controls)\n- `tests/copilot-smoke/baseline.json`: regenerate after case remapping\n- `tests/agent-routing/cases.json`: remap evidence paths and skill references to new names\n\n**4. Regenerate baselines**\n- Run `validate-similarity.py` to produce new `similarity-baseline.json` (fewer, more distinct skills = likely all zeros)\n- Clear or regenerate `similarity-suppressions.json` (old pairs like ado-publish/gha-publish no longer exist)\n- Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n\n**5. Update documentation**\n- `README.md`: update skill count (line 11), category table (lines 53-76), Mermaid diagram skill counts (lines 126-150), \"Agent Skill Routing Checks\" section (lines 222-228)\n- `AGENTS.md`: update skill count (line 28), file structure diagram (line 81)\n- `CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md`: update Copilot 32-skill section count (lines 117-143), budget math formula (lines 189-200), cross-provider verification command (lines 329-335)\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: update cross-provider change policy command (line 247), release checklist (lines 254-263)\n- `docs/agent-routing-tests.md`: trim to match surviving test infrastructure (remove eval harness references)\n- `CHANGELOG.md`: add entry under [Unreleased] for skill consolidation and eval harness removal\n\n## Key context\n\n- Structural validators (`validate-skills.sh`, `validate-marketplace.sh`, `validate-similarity.py`) are the real CI gates \u2014 keep them as-is\n- The eval harness never ran in CI; it was a local development tool\n- With ~20 skills the description budget drops from ~75% to ~15-20%, dramatically improving routing quality\n- The similarity detector becomes MORE valuable with broader skills (higher chance of vocabulary overlap)\n- All eval JSONL datasets, rubrics, and baselines reference old 131-skill names \u2014 remapping would be as much work as deletion, with no CI benefit\n## Approach\n\n1. **CI gates**: Update `EXPECTED=N` in `validate.yml:213`, `--projected-skills N` in `validate-skills.sh:71` to match actual consolidated count\n2. **Similarity baseline**: Regenerate `similarity-baseline.json` (all zeros expected with fewer, more distinct skills)\n3. **Similarity suppressions**: Update or clear `similarity-suppressions.json` (old ado-publish/gha-publish pair no longer exists)\n4. **Routing warnings baseline**: Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n5. **Eval datasets**: Remap all `expected_skills`, `acceptable_skills`, `expected_skill` fields from old names to new names across activation (73 cases), confusion (54 cases), effectiveness (12 rubrics), size_impact (11 candidates)\n6. **Confusion matrix**: Rewrite `DOMAIN_GROUPS` dict in `run_confusion_matrix.py:46-88` for ~20 skills (may simplify significantly)\n7. **Copilot smoke tests**: Remap `cases.jsonl` and `baseline.json` (29 cases)\n8. **Agent routing tests**: Remap `cases.json` evidence paths\n9. **Documentation**: Update skill count and catalog in README.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, AGENTS.md\n\n## Key context\n\n- Description budget drops from ~75% to ~15-20% \u2014 significant routing quality improvement\n- Confusion matrix eval concept may simplify dramatically with only ~20 skills (fewer overlapping domains)\n- Eval dataset remapping is data changes only \u2014 no running of actual eval suites here\n## Approach\n\n1. **CI gates**: Update `EXPECTED=N` in `validate.yml:213`, `--projected-skills N` in `validate-skills.sh:71` to match actual consolidated count\n2. **Similarity baseline**: Regenerate `similarity-baseline.json` (all zeros expected with fewer, more distinct skills)\n3. **Similarity suppressions**: Update or clear `similarity-suppressions.json` (old ado-publish/gha-publish pair no longer exists)\n4. **Routing warnings baseline**: Regenerate `routing-warnings-baseline.json`\n5. **Eval datasets**: Remap all `expected_skills`, `acceptable_skills`, `expected_skill` fields from old names to new names across activation (73 cases), confusion (54 cases), effectiveness (12 rubrics), size_impact (11 candidates)\n6. **Confusion matrix**: Rewrite `DOMAIN_GROUPS` dict in `run_confusion_matrix.py:46-88` for ~20 skills (may simplify significantly)\n7. **Copilot smoke tests**: Remap `cases.jsonl` and `baseline.json` (29 cases)\n8. **Agent routing tests**: Remap `cases.json` evidence paths\n9. **Documentation**: Update skill count and catalog in README.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, AGENTS.md\n10. **Run full eval suite**: All 4 types (activation, confusion, effectiveness, size_impact), save new baselines\n\n## Key context\n\n- Description budget drops from ~75% to ~15-20% \u2014 significant routing quality improvement\n- Confusion matrix eval concept may simplify dramatically with only ~20 skills (fewer overlapping domains)\n- Eval baselines from fn-60 must be fully regenerated \u2014 old baselines are keyed by old skill names\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `tests/evals/` directory deleted entirely\n- [ ] `validate.yml` EXPECTED count updated to match actual consolidated skill count\n- [ ] `validate-skills.sh --projected-skills` updated to new count\n- [ ] `STRICT_REFS=1` is default in CI validation step\n- [ ] Copilot smoke `cases.jsonl` remapped to new skill names (~10-15 cases)\n- [ ] Copilot smoke `baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] Agent routing `cases.json` remapped to new skill names\n- [ ] `similarity-baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] `similarity-suppressions.json` updated (old pairs removed)\n- [ ] `routing-warnings-baseline.json` regenerated\n- [ ] README.md updated (skill count, category table, Mermaid diagram)\n- [ ] AGENTS.md updated (skill count, file structure)\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md updated (count, budget math, verification commands)\n- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md updated (cross-provider command, release checklist)\n- [ ] `docs/agent-routing-tests.md` updated for surviving test infrastructure\n- [ ] `./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` both pass\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"
