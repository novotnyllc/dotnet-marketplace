    "spec": "# fn-6: Serialization & Communication Skills\n\n## Overview\nDelivers AOT-friendly serialization and service communication skills including System.Text.Json source generators, gRPC, real-time communication patterns, and service communication routing. These are **communication-focused** skills covering data formats and transport protocols. Core language patterns live in fn-3; architecture patterns in fn-5; Native AOT depth in fn-16.\n\n## Scope\n**Skills (4 total, directory: `skills/serialization/<name>/SKILL.md`):**\n\n| Skill ID | Directory | Summary |\n|----------|-----------|---------|\n| `dotnet-serialization` | `skills/serialization/dotnet-serialization/` | AOT-friendly source-gen serialization: System.Text.Json source gen, Protobuf, MessagePack. Performance tradeoffs. |\n| `dotnet-grpc` | `skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/` | Full gRPC skill: service definition, code-gen, streaming, auth, load balancing, health checks |\n| `dotnet-realtime-communication` | `skills/serialization/dotnet-realtime-communication/` | Service communication patterns: SignalR, JSON-RPC 2.0, Server-Sent Events, gRPC streaming. When to use what. |\n| `dotnet-service-communication` | `skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/` | Higher-level routing skill with decision matrix mapping requirements to gRPC, SignalR, SSE, JSON-RPC, REST |\n\n**Naming convention:** All skills use `dotnet-` prefix. Noun style for reference skills.\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n\n| Concern | fn-6 owns (serialization & communication) | Other epic owns (depth) | Enforcement |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Source generators | Cross-references `[skill:dotnet-csharp-source-generators]`; mandatory in serialization, conditional in gRPC | fn-3: owns source generator authoring patterns | Grep validates cross-ref in serialization skill |\n| AOT compatibility | Notes AOT-safe serialization choices; `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` with `TODO(fn-16)` marker | fn-16: owns AOT architecture, trimming strategies | Grep validates `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` + `TODO(fn-16)` in all 4 skills |\n| HTTP client / REST | `dotnet-service-communication` routes REST questions to `[skill:dotnet-http-client]` | fn-5: owns IHttpClientFactory patterns | Cross-ref validates routing |\n| Resilience | Cross-references `[skill:dotnet-resilience]` for retry/circuit-breaker on gRPC channels | fn-5: owns Polly v8 resilience patterns | Cross-ref in gRPC skill |\n| Testing | Deferred cross-refs to fn-7 skills with `TODO(fn-7)` marker \u2014 added when fn-7 lands | fn-7: owns testing strategies and frameworks | Grep validates `TODO(fn-7)` markers; fn-7 reconciliation replaces |\n| Blazor SignalR | fn-6 covers SignalR transport patterns; Blazor-specific usage deferred to fn-12 | fn-12: owns Blazor skills | Out-of-scope boundary statement in realtime skill |\n\n## Deferred Cross-Reference Format\nAll deferred cross-references follow a standardized format:\n- Literal cross-ref ID: `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]`, `[skill:dotnet-integration-testing]`\n- TODO marker: `TODO(fn-16)`, `TODO(fn-7)`\n- Example: `<!-- TODO(fn-16): Replace with canonical cross-ref when fn-16 lands --> See [skill:dotnet-native-aot] for AOT architecture depth.`\n\n## Boundary Applicability Matrix\nNot all boundary epics require explicit out-of-scope statements in all skills. The fn-7 (testing) boundary is satisfied by the deferred placeholder format above \u2014 skills include literal fn-7 skill IDs with `TODO(fn-7)` markers rather than separate out-of-scope prose.\n\n| Epic boundary | fn-6.1 skills | fn-6.2 skills | Enforcement mechanism |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| fn-3 (source generators) | Out-of-scope statement | N/A | Grep for boundary text |\n| fn-5 (resilience/HTTP) | Out-of-scope statement | Out-of-scope statement | Grep for boundary text |\n| fn-7 (testing) | Deferred placeholder format | Deferred placeholder format | Grep for `TODO(fn-7)` + literal skill ID |\n| fn-12 (Blazor) | N/A | Out-of-scope statement in realtime | Grep for boundary text |\n| fn-16 (AOT) | Out-of-scope statement | Out-of-scope statement | Grep for boundary text + `TODO(fn-16)` |\n\n## Task Decomposition\n\n### fn-6.1: Serialization and gRPC skills (parallelizable content, fn-6.2 owns integration)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-serialization`, `dotnet-grpc`\n- `skills/serialization/dotnet-serialization/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md`\n- Both require `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- `dotnet-serialization` covers STJ source generators, Protobuf, MessagePack with performance tradeoffs\n- `dotnet-serialization` warns against reflection-based serialization (Newtonsoft.Json) for AOT\n- `dotnet-serialization` mandatory cross-ref: `[skill:dotnet-csharp-source-generators]`\n- `dotnet-grpc` covers .proto definition, code-gen, ASP.NET Core gRPC server implementation + endpoint hosting, Grpc.Net.Client for client patterns, all 4 streaming patterns (unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional streaming \u2014 each named explicitly), auth, load balancing, health checks\n- `dotnet-grpc` conditional cross-ref: `[skill:dotnet-csharp-source-generators]` only if discussing generator-adjacent scenarios\n- `dotnet-grpc` cross-references `[skill:dotnet-resilience]` for retry/circuit-breaker on gRPC channels\n- Both include `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` with `TODO(fn-16)` marker\n- Both include deferred fn-7 testing placeholders using standardized format: `[skill:dotnet-integration-testing]` plus `TODO(fn-7)` marker\n- Both include explicit out-of-scope boundary statements for fn-3, fn-5, fn-16\n- Skill name uniqueness: advisory pre-check in fn-6.1 (hard gate in fn-6.2)\n- Does NOT touch `plugin.json` (handled by fn-6.2)\n\n### fn-6.2: Real-time and service communication routing skills + integration (depends on fn-6.1 for cross-ref targets)\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-realtime-communication`, `dotnet-service-communication`, plus plugin registration for all 4 skills\n- `skills/serialization/dotnet-realtime-communication/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md`\n- `dotnet-realtime-communication` compares SignalR, SSE (.NET 10 built-in), JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC streaming\n- `dotnet-realtime-communication` includes out-of-scope boundary for fn-12 (Blazor-specific SignalR)\n- `dotnet-service-communication` contains decision matrix mapping requirements to all 5 protocols: gRPC, SignalR, SSE, JSON-RPC, REST \u2014 with cross-refs to deeper skills\n- Both include `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` with `TODO(fn-16)` marker \u2014 required in both (not conditional)\n- Both include deferred fn-7 testing placeholders using standardized format: `[skill:dotnet-integration-testing]` plus `TODO(fn-7)` marker\n- `dotnet-realtime-communication` includes out-of-scope boundary for fn-12 (Blazor-specific SignalR); `dotnet-service-communication` does not require fn-12 boundary (not SignalR-focused)\n- Both include explicit out-of-scope boundary statements for fn-5 and fn-16 (fn-7 boundary satisfied by deferred placeholder format per applicability matrix)\n- Registers all 4 skill paths in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, grouped under `skills/serialization/*`, alphabetical within group\n- Runs `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` and repo-wide name uniqueness check (hard gate)\n- Grep validates: `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` in all 4 skills, `TODO(fn-16)` markers in all 4, `TODO(fn-7)` markers with literal fn-7 skill IDs\n- Single owner of `plugin.json` changes \u2014 eliminates merge conflicts\n\n**fn-7 Reconciliation:** When fn-7 lands, a follow-up task must replace `TODO(fn-7)` markers and deferred placeholder comments with canonical `[skill:...]` cross-references. This reconciliation is tracked as a dependency note in fn-7's spec.\n\n## Key Context\n- System.Text.Json source generators are AOT-friendly and required for Native AOT\n- Reflection-based serialization (Newtonsoft.Json) is incompatible with trimming/AOT\n- .NET 10 brings built-in Server-Sent Events support to ASP.NET Core\n- gRPC is the recommended approach for service-to-service communication in .NET\n- Protobuf is the default gRPC wire format; MessagePack is an alternative for specific scenarios\n- SignalR supports multiple transports: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long Polling\n- JSON-RPC 2.0 is used by Language Server Protocol and some .NET tooling\n\n## Quick Commands\n```bash\n# Validate all 4 skills exist with frontmatter\nfor s in dotnet-serialization dotnet-grpc dotnet-realtime-communication dotnet-service-communication; do\n  test -f \"skills/serialization/$s/SKILL.md\" && echo \"OK: $s\" || echo \"MISSING: $s\"\ndone\n\n# Validate frontmatter has required fields (name AND description)\nfor s in skills/serialization/*/SKILL.md; do\n  grep -q \"^name:\" \"$s\" && grep -q \"^description:\" \"$s\" && echo \"OK: $s\" || echo \"MISSING FRONTMATTER: $s\"\ndone\n\n# Repo-wide skill name uniqueness check\ngrep -rh \"^name:\" skills/*/*/SKILL.md | sort | uniq -d  # expect empty (no duplicates)\n\n# Canonical frontmatter validation\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh\n\n# Verify serialization skill covers source generators (mandatory cross-ref)\ngrep \"\\[skill:dotnet-csharp-source-generators\\]\" skills/serialization/dotnet-serialization/SKILL.md\n\n# Verify gRPC covers all 4 streaming patterns explicitly (separate checks for deterministic evidence)\ngrep -qi \"unary\" skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: unary\" || echo \"MISSING: unary\"\ngrep -qi \"server streaming\" skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: server streaming\" || echo \"MISSING: server streaming\"\ngrep -qi \"client streaming\" skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: client streaming\" || echo \"MISSING: client streaming\"\ngrep -qi \"bidirectional\" skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: bidirectional\" || echo \"MISSING: bidirectional\"\n\n# Verify gRPC covers server-side patterns (ASP.NET Core gRPC)\ngrep -qi \"service implementation\\|endpoint hosting\\|MapGrpcService\\|GrpcService\" skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: server patterns\" || echo \"MISSING: server patterns\"\n\n# Verify AOT deferred placeholders (standardized format)\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-native-aot\\]\" skills/serialization/  # expect 4 matches\ngrep -r \"TODO(fn-16)\" skills/serialization/  # expect 4 matches\n\n# Verify fn-7 deferred testing placeholders in all 4 skills (literal skill ID + TODO marker)\nfor s in dotnet-serialization dotnet-grpc dotnet-realtime-communication dotnet-service-communication; do\n  grep -q \"TODO(fn-7)\" \"skills/serialization/$s/SKILL.md\" && echo \"OK: $s TODO(fn-7)\" || echo \"MISSING: $s TODO(fn-7)\"\n  grep -q \"\\[skill:dotnet-integration-testing\\]\" \"skills/serialization/$s/SKILL.md\" && echo \"OK: $s fn-7 skill ID\" || echo \"MISSING: $s fn-7 skill ID\"\ndone\n\n# Verify cross-references\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-resilience\\]\" skills/serialization/dotnet-grpc/SKILL.md\ngrep -r \"\\[skill:dotnet-http-client\\]\" skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md\n\n# Verify service-communication decision matrix covers all 5 protocols (separate checks for deterministic evidence)\ngrep -qi \"gRPC\" skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: gRPC\" || echo \"MISSING: gRPC\"\ngrep -qi \"SignalR\" skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: SignalR\" || echo \"MISSING: SignalR\"\ngrep -qi \"SSE\\|Server-Sent Events\" skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: SSE\" || echo \"MISSING: SSE\"\ngrep -qi \"JSON-RPC\" skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: JSON-RPC\" || echo \"MISSING: JSON-RPC\"\ngrep -qi \"REST\" skills/serialization/dotnet-service-communication/SKILL.md && echo \"OK: REST\" || echo \"MISSING: REST\"\n\n# Verify out-of-scope boundary statements\ngrep -l \"fn-12\\|Blazor\" skills/serialization/dotnet-realtime-communication/SKILL.md  # expect 1\ngrep -l \"out-of-scope\\|boundary\" skills/serialization/*/SKILL.md | wc -l  # expect 4\n\n# Verify plugin.json ordering (serialization skills grouped and alphabetical)\ngrep \"skills/serialization\" .claude-plugin/plugin.json\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. All 4 skills exist at `skills/serialization/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter\n2. Serialization skill covers STJ source generators, Protobuf, MessagePack with AOT compatibility notes\n3. Serialization skill includes performance tradeoff guidance (STJ vs Protobuf vs MessagePack)\n4. Serialization skill warns against reflection-based serialization (Newtonsoft.Json) for AOT scenarios\n5. gRPC skill covers full lifecycle: .proto definition, code-gen, client/server patterns, all 4 streaming patterns named explicitly (unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional streaming)\n6. gRPC skill covers authentication, load balancing, health checks, and Grpc.Net.Client usage\n6a. gRPC skill cross-references `[skill:dotnet-resilience]` for retry/circuit-breaker on gRPC channels\n7. Real-time communication skill compares SignalR, SSE (.NET 10 built-in), JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC streaming with decision guidance\n8. Service communication skill contains decision matrix mapping requirements to all 5 protocols: gRPC, SignalR, SSE, JSON-RPC, REST \u2014 with cross-refs to deeper skills\n9. Serialization skill mandatory cross-ref: `[skill:dotnet-csharp-source-generators]`; gRPC skill conditional cross-ref only if discussing generator-adjacent scenarios\n10. All 4 skills include `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` with `TODO(fn-16)` marker (standardized deferred placeholder format)\n11. Each skill contains explicit out-of-scope boundary statements per the applicability matrix: fn-3 (fn-6.1 only), fn-5, fn-12 (realtime skill only), fn-16 \u2014 grep-validated. fn-7 boundary is satisfied by deferred placeholder format (criterion #12), not separate prose.\n12. All 4 skills contain deferred fn-7 testing placeholders using standardized format: `[skill:dotnet-integration-testing]` plus `TODO(fn-7)` marker\n13. All 4 skills registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, grouped under `skills/serialization/*`, alphabetical within group\n14. `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes for all 4 skills\n15. Skill `name` frontmatter values are unique repo-wide (hard gate in fn-6.2; advisory in fn-6.1)\n16. fn-6.1 content is parallelizable with fn-6.2 content work; fn-6.2 owns plugin.json integration (file-disjoint for skill content)\n\n## Test Notes\n- Verify serialization skill detects non-AOT-friendly patterns (reflection-based serialization)\n- Test that service-communication skill routes to appropriate specialized skills via decision matrix\n- Validate gRPC skill covers both ASP.NET Core gRPC and Grpc.Net.Client\n- Validate gRPC skill names all 4 streaming patterns explicitly (not just \"streaming\")\n- Verify SSE coverage notes .NET 10 built-in support\n- Verify SignalR coverage includes transport negotiation and fallback\n- Run `grep -rh \"^name:\" skills/*/*/SKILL.md | sort | uniq -d` to confirm no duplicate names repo-wide\n- Verify `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` and `TODO(fn-16)` present in all 4 skills\n- Verify `TODO(fn-7)` deferred testing placeholders present\n- Verify boundary cross-references use canonical skill IDs (not shorthand)\n- Verify out-of-scope boundary statements are present where applicable\n- Verify `plugin.json` contains all 4 serialization skill paths after fn-6.2, grouped and alphabetical\n\n## References\n- System.Text.Json Source Generators: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/source-generation\n- gRPC for .NET: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-10.0\n- Native AOT Deployment: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/\n- SignalR: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-10.0\n- Server-Sent Events (.NET 10): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/server-sent-events?view=aspnetcore-10.0\n- dotnet-skills serialization reference: https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/dotnet-skills\n"
