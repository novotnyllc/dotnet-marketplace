    "spec": "# fn-24: Cross-Agent Build Pipeline\n\n## Problem/Goal\nCreate dotnet tool for inner loop validation and GitHub Action for cross-agent format generation, producing Claude Code plugin, GitHub Copilot instructions, and OpenAI Codex AGENTS.md from canonical SKILL.md source.\n\n## Acceptance Checks\n- [ ] dotnet tool created for local development (validates skill format, frontmatter, cross-references, generates dist/ outputs)\n- [ ] GitHub Action workflow generates dist/claude/, dist/copilot/, dist/codex/ on push/release\n- [ ] Action publishes to Claude Code marketplace\n- [ ] Action creates GitHub Release with all artifacts\n- [ ] Build pipeline validates skill format, frontmatter, cross-references, markdown lint\n- [ ] Cross-agent conformance test suite validates behavioral equivalence across generated outputs\n- [ ] Cross-references to CI/CD skills, packaging skills\n\n## Cross-Agent Conformance Tests\n\nGeneration success \u2260 behavioral equivalence. The build pipeline must include a conformance test suite:\n\n### Required Tests\n1. **Routing parity**: Every canonical SKILL.md trigger phrase appears in all generated agent formats (Claude plugin description, Copilot `applyTo` instructions, Codex AGENTS.md sections)\n2. **Trigger coverage**: Spot-check that sample queries would activate the same skill across all three agent formats\n3. **Graceful degradation**: Verify that Claude-only features (hooks, MCP, agents) are cleanly omitted from Copilot/Codex outputs without broken references or dangling cross-refs\n4. **Semantic diff**: Detect unintended content drift between canonical SKILL.md and generated outputs (beyond expected format transformations)\n5. **Cross-reference integrity**: All `[skill:name]` references in generated outputs resolve to valid targets within that agent's format\n\n### Implementation\n- Tests run as part of the dotnet tool validation (`dotnet artisan validate --cross-agent`)\n- CI gate: conformance failures block merge\n- Report format: per-skill pass/fail with diff for failures\n\n## Dependencies\n- fn-19 (CI/CD Skills) \u2014 pipeline patterns and workflow templates\n- fn-23 (Hooks & MCP Integration) \u2014 conformance tests must validate against the fully-featured Claude baseline including hooks and MCP, not a partial implementation\n\n## Trigger Corpus\nTrigger coverage tests (item 2 above) must use a **deterministic minimum corpus** of at least 20 representative queries spanning all skill categories. The corpus is a maintained test artifact (not ad-hoc spot checks) and must be updated when skills are added or renamed.\n\n## Key Context\n- Canonical source is skills/ directory using Agent Skills SKILL.md format\n- Cross-agent compatibility via build-time generation (not manual duplication)\n- Inner loop validation prevents broken commits\n- Publishing workflow uses NBGV for versioning\n"
