    "spec": "# fn-20: Packaging and Publishing Skills\n\n## Overview\nDelivers comprehensive NuGet package authoring, MSIX packaging, and release management skills covering modern package creation, signing, distribution, versioning strategy, and release lifecycle. These are **depth skills** focused on the packaging/publishing *concepts* \u2014 when to use, configuration, signing, and distribution. CI pipeline execution for these packaging steps is owned by fn-19 (`[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]`, `[skill:dotnet-ado-publish]`); fn-20 owns the packaging knowledge itself. Project-level configuration (CPM, SourceLink, nuget.config) is owned by fn-4 (`[skill:dotnet-project-structure]`); fn-20 owns NuGet package authoring for library consumers.\n\n**Skills (4 total):**\n- `dotnet-nuget-authoring` \u2014 NuGet package authoring: SDK-style csproj properties, source generator packaging, multi-TFM packages, symbol packages, package signing, validation, API compatibility\n- `dotnet-msix` \u2014 MSIX packaging pipeline: creation, signing with certificates, distribution channels (Microsoft Store, App Installer, sideloading), auto-update, CI build integration\n- `dotnet-github-releases` \u2014 GitHub Releases for .NET: release creation, asset attachment, release notes generation (auto-generated, changelog-based, conventional commits), pre-release management\n- `dotnet-release-management` \u2014 Release lifecycle: NBGV, SemVer strategy, changelog generation, pre-release workflows, version bumping, release branching\n\n**Agents:** None for this epic. Packaging guidance is delivered through skills only. The `dotnet-architect` agent can load packaging skills contextually via `[skill:dotnet-nuget-authoring]` or `[skill:dotnet-msix]` references.\n\n**Naming convention:** All skills use `dotnet-` prefix. Noun style for reference skills. Directory: `skills/packaging/` for NuGet/MSIX/GitHub-Releases; `skills/release-management/` for release-management.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Hard epic dependencies:**\n- fn-19 (CI/CD): `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]` and `[skill:dotnet-ado-publish]` must exist for CI publish workflow cross-refs in NuGet and MSIX skills\n\n**Soft epic dependencies:**\n- fn-4 (Project Structure): `[skill:dotnet-project-structure]` owns CPM, SourceLink, nuget.config \u2014 fn-20 cross-refs without re-teaching\n- fn-16 (Native AOT): `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` for AOT+MSIX scenarios \u2014 soft cross-ref\n- fn-17 (CLI Tools): `[skill:dotnet-cli-release-pipeline]` and `[skill:dotnet-cli-packaging]` for scope boundary cross-refs \u2014 already shipped\n- fn-13 (UI Frameworks): `[skill:dotnet-winui]` for WinUI MSIX packaging modes \u2014 already shipped\n\n## .NET Version Policy\n\n**Baseline:** .NET 8.0+ (LTS)\n\n| Component | Version | Notes |\n|-----------|---------|-------|\n| NuGet SDK-style packaging | .NET 8+ | `dotnet pack`, `PackageReference`, `PackageId` |\n| Source generator packaging | .NET 8+ | `IIncrementalGenerator`, `buildTransitive` folder layout |\n| Package validation | .NET 8+ | `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.Task` for API compat |\n| MSIX packaging | Windows 10 build 19041+ | Minimum for Windows App SDK 1.6+

`.msixbundle` for multi-arch |\n| NBGV | .NET 8+ | `Nerdbank.GitVersioning` for version calculation |\n| GitHub Releases API | N/A | Platform-independent |\n\n## Conventions\n\n- **Frontmatter:** Required fields are `name` and `description` only\n- **Cross-reference syntax:** `[skill:skill-name]` for all skill references\n- **Description budget:** Target < 120 characters per skill description\n- **Out-of-scope format:** \"**Out of scope:**\" paragraph with epic ownership attribution\n- **Code examples:** XML for MSBuild/csproj, YAML for CI snippets (cross-ref only), PowerShell/bash for CLI commands\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n\n| Concern | fn-20 owns | Other epic owns | Enforcement |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|\n| NuGet package authoring | SDK csproj properties, package metadata, source generator packaging, multi-TFM, signing, validation, API compat | fn-4: `dotnet-project-structure` (CPM, SourceLink, nuget.config, NuGet Audit, lock files) | Cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-project-structure]`; no re-teach CPM/SourceLink |\n| NuGet CI publish workflows | Scope boundary only \u2014 cross-ref to CI skills | fn-19: `dotnet-gha-publish`,

packaging | MSIX creation, signing, distribution, Store, auto-update | fn-13: `dotnet-winui` (WinUI MSIX vs unpackaged modes, Package.appxmanifest basics) | Cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-winui]`; no re-teach WinUI packaging mode comparison |\n| MSIX in CI | MSIX build/sign steps for CI pipelines | fn-19: `dotnet-gha-patterns`, `dotnet-ado-patterns` (general CI patterns) | Cross-ref CI skills for

only) | fn-16: `dotnet-native-aot` (AOT MSBuild properties) | Cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]`; no re-teach AOT config |\n\n## Cross-Reference Classification\n\n| Target Skill | Type | Used By | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `[skill:dotnet-project-structure]` | Hard | `dotnet-nuget-authoring` | CPM, SourceLink \u2014 do not re-teach |\n| `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]` | Hard | `dotnet-nuget-authoring`, `dotnet-github-releases` | CI publish workflows |\n| `[skill:dotnet-ado-publish]` | Hard | `dotnet-nuget-authoring` | ADO publish workflows |\n| `[skill:dotnet-winui]` | Hard

| Scope boundary |\n| `[skill:dotnet-cli-packaging]` | Hard | `dotnet-nuget-authoring` | Scope boundary |\n| `[skill:dotnet-add-ci]` | Soft | All | Starter template context |\n| `[skill:plugin-self-publish]` | Hard | `dotnet-release-management` | Scope boundary |\n\n## Task Decomposition\n\n### fn-20.1: Create NuGet authoring and MSIX skills \u2014 parallelizable with fn-20.2\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-nuget-authoring`, `dotnet-msix`\n- `skills/packaging/dotnet-nuget-authoring/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/packaging/dotnet-msix/SKILL.md`\n- Both require `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- Cross-references:\n  - `[skill:dotnet-project-structure]` (fn-4) for CPM, SourceLink \u2014 do not re-teach\n  - `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]` / `[skill:dotnet-ado-publish]` (fn-19) for CI publish workflows \u2014 do not re-teach\n  - `[skill:dotnet-cli-packaging]` (fn-17) scope boundary\n  - `[skill:dotnet-winui]` (fn-13) for WinUI MSIX packaging modes \u2014 do not re-teach\n  - `[skill:dotnet-native-aot]` (fn-16) for AOT+MSIX scenarios\n- Each skill must contain out-of-scope boundary statements\n- Does NOT modify `plugin.json` or `dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md` (handled by fn-20.3)\n\n### fn-20.2: Create GitHub Releases and Release Management skills \u2014 parallelizable with fn-20.1\n**Delivers:** `dotnet-github-releases`, `dotnet-release-management`\n- `skills/packaging/dotnet-github-releases/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/release-management/dotnet-release-management/SKILL.md`\n- Both require `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- Cross-references:\n  - `[skill:dotnet-cli-release-pipeline]` (fn-17) scope boundary\n  - `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]` / `[skill:dotnet-gha-patterns]` (fn-19) for CI workflow cross-refs\n  - `[skill:plugin-self-publish]` (fn-2) scope boundary for release management\n- Each skill must contain out-of-scope boundary statements\n- Does NOT modify `plugin.json` or `dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md` (handled by fn-20.3)\n\n### fn-20.3: Integration \u2014 plugin registration, advisor catalog, validation, cross-reference reconciliation (depends on fn-20.1, fn-20.2)\n**Delivers:** Plugin registration, advisor update, cross-reference reconciliation, validation\n- Registers all 4 skill paths in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` under `skills` array:\n  - `skills/packaging/dotnet-nuget-authoring`\n  - `skills/packaging/dotnet-msix`\n  - `skills/packaging/dotnet-github-releases`\n  - `skills/release-management/dotnet-release-management`\n- Updates `skills/foundation/dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md`:\n  - Section 15 (\"Packaging & Publishing\") from `planned` to `implemented`\n  - Section 16 (\"Release Management\") from `planned` to `implemented`\n  - Updates `[skill:dotnet-nuget-modern]` reference to `[skill:dotnet-nuget-authoring]` (name change)\n  - Verifies all skill names match their SKILL.md `name` frontmatter values exactly\n- Resolves any `<!-- TODO(fn-20) -->` placeholders in existing skills (run `grep -r 'TODO(fn-20)' skills/` \u2014 expect empty, but verify)\n- Runs repo-wide skill name uniqueness check\n- Runs `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`\n- Validates cross-references present in all 4 skills\n- Single owner of `plugin.json` \u2014 eliminates merge conflicts\n\n**Execution order:** fn-20.1 and fn-20.2 are parallelizable (file-disjoint, no shared file edits). fn-20.3 depends on both fn-20.1 and fn-20.2.\n\n## Key Context\n- Central Package Management is the modern standard for multi-project NuGet version management \u2014 owned by `dotnet-project-structure`\n- fn-20's `dotnet-nuget-authoring` focuses on creating packages (for library authors), not consuming them\n- MSIX is the modern Windows app packaging format (replaces ClickOnce, MSI for many scenarios)\n- `dotnet-winui` already covers MSIX packaged vs unpackaged deployment modes \u2014 fn-20's `dotnet-msix` goes deeper into signing, distribution, Store submission, and auto-update\n- GitHub Releases + NBGV provide a complete release lifecycle for .NET projects\n- `dotnet-cli-release-pipeline` (fn-17) covers CLI-specific release automation \u2014 fn-20's `dotnet-github-releases` covers general .NET project releases\n- The advisor catalog lists these skills under sections 15 (Packaging & Publishing) and 16 (Release Management) \u2014 both go to `implemented` after fn-20\n- fn-27 (Roslyn Analyzer Authoring) has a scope boundary note: \"Analyzer-specific NuGet layout \u2014 cross-ref to fn-20 when it lands\"\n\n## Quick Commands\n```bash\n# Validate all 4 skills exist with frontmatter\nfor s in

Each skill needs `name` and `description` frontmatter, comprehensive content with code examples, out-of-scope boundary statements, and cross-references. This task is parallelizable with fn-20.1 (file-disjoint).\n\n**`dotnet-github-releases`** covers:\n- Release creation via `gh release create` CLI and GitHub API\n- Asset attachment patterns (NuGet packages, binaries, SBOMs, checksums)\n- `softprops/action-gh-release` GHA action usage (brief, cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]` for full CI workflow)\n- Release notes generation strategies (GitHub auto-generated, changelog-based, conventional commits)\n- Pre-release management (draft releases, pre-release flag, promoting pre-release to stable)\n- Tag-triggered vs release-triggered workflows (concept only, cross-ref CI skills for YAML)\n- Does NOT re-teach CLI-specific release pipelines (cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-cli-release-pipeline]`)\n- Does NOT re-teach GHA workflow syntax (cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-gha-patterns]`)\n\n**`dotnet-release-management`** covers:\n- NBGV (`Nerdbank.GitVersioning`) setup: `version.json` configuration, version height, public release vs pre-release\n- SemVer 2.0 strategy for .NET libraries (when to bump major/minor/patch)\n- SemVer for applications (build metadata, deployment versioning)\n- Changelog generation (Keep a Changelog format, auto-generation with tools, conventional commit integration)\n- Pre-release version workflows (alpha \u2192 beta \u2192 rc \u2192 stable)\n- Release branching patterns (release branches, hotfix branches, trunk-based with tags)\n- Does NOT re-teach plugin-specific release workflow (cross-ref `[skill:plugin-self-publish]`)\n- Does NOT re-teach CI publish workflows (cross-ref `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]`/`[skill:dotnet-ado-publish]`)\n\n**Files created:**\n- `skills/packaging/dotnet-github-releases/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/release-management/dotnet-release-management/SKILL.md`\n\n**Files NOT modified:** `plugin.json`, `dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md` (handled by fn-20.3)\n\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `skills/packaging/dotnet-github-releases/SKILL.md` exists with `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- [ ] `dotnet-github-releases` covers release creation, asset attachment, release notes generation, pre-release management\n- [ ] `dotnet-github-releases` cross-refs `[skill:dotnet-cli-release-pipeline]` with scope boundary\n- [ ] `dotnet-github-releases` cross-refs `[skill:dotnet-gha-publish]` for CI workflow context\n- [ ] `dotnet-github-releases` contains out-of-scope boundary statement\n- [ ] `skills/release-management/dotnet-release-management/SKILL.md` exists with `name` and `description` frontmatter\n- [ ] `dotnet-release-management` covers NBGV, SemVer strategy, changelog generation, pre-release workflows, release branching\n- [ ] `dotnet-release-management` cross-refs `[skill:plugin-self-publish]` with scope boundary\n- [ ] `dotnet-release-management` contains out-of-scope boundary statement\n- [ ] Description frontmatter < 120 chars per skill\n\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"
