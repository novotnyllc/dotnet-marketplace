    "spec": "# Copilot Structural Compatibility\n\n## Overview\n\nMake dotnet-artisan's skill directory layout, YAML frontmatter, and validators compatible with GitHub Copilot CLI and VS Code Copilot Chat, while preserving full Claude Code and Codex functionality.\n\n**Problem:** Copilot discovers skills by scanning one level deep under `skills/`. The current nested layout (`skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`) causes Copilot to interpret category directories as skill names, finding zero actual skills. Additionally, YAML frontmatter quirks (quoted descriptions, missing `license:` field) cause silent load failures in Copilot CLI.\n\n**Critical constraint:** Copilot CLI has a hard ~32 skill display limit in the system prompt (issues #1464, #1130). With 130 skills, only the first ~32 alphabetically are visible. This requires a routing strategy, not just a flatten.\n\n## Research Sources\n\n- **VS Code Copilot Chat source** (`microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat`): `relativePath.split('/')[0]` confirms one-level-deep scanning\n- **Copilot CLI changelog**: v0.0.413 (today) did NOT change nested directory behavior; only fixed YAML array `allowed-tools`\n- **Agent Skills spec** (`agentskills.io/specification`): Defines flat `skill-name/SKILL.md` layout; all reference repos use flat\n- **Copilot CLI issues**: #1464 (32-skill limit), #894 (license required), #1024 (quoted descriptions fail), #951 (metadata last field), #1021 (symlinks ignored)\n- **dotnet-skills-evals**: DSPy eval framework; compressed-index discovery mechanism tested at 56.5% TPR\n- **dotnet-skills issue #48**: Progressive disclosure for skills >500 lines\n- **Existing work on `copilot-refactor` branch**: Smoke runners, baseline JSONs, validator updates already committed\n\n## Scope\n\n- Flatten `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/` to `skills/<skill-name>/` (131 directories)\n- Update all 132 `plugin.json` skill paths\n- Migrate all 131 SKILL.md frontmatter for Copilot safety\n- Update validators, baselines, and depth-sensitive scripts\n- Design and implement 32-skill routing strategy\n- Update all documentation referencing the nested layout\n\n## Out of scope\n\n- Copilot Extensions/Skillsets API (different feature from Agent Skills)\n- Changes to hook scripts or MCP server configuration (Copilot handles these differently; addressed if testing reveals issues)\n- Copilot CLI installation/distribution (users install separately)\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Atomic flatten** in a single commit using `git mv` to preserve history\n2. **Frontmatter migration** scripted across all 131 SKILL.md files\n3. **Validator updates** additive (new flat-layout checks alongside existing)\n4. **32-skill strategy**: Leverage `dotnet-advisor` as meta-router (alphabetically ~8th, within visible set); advisor's compressed catalog serves as Level 2 index for all 130 skills\n5. **Documentation** updated in a dedicated pass after structural changes stabilize\n\n## Risks\n\n- **plugin.json + filesystem inconsistency** causes all Claude Code skill loading to fail \u2192 mitigated by atomic commit\n- **Codex sync breaks** due to `find -mindepth 2` in `test.sh:129` \u2192 explicit fix in flatten task\n- **Description unquoting** may break YAML for descriptions with special characters \u2192 scripted with validation pass\n- **Baseline invalidation** across routing-warnings and similarity baselines \u2192 reset in validator task\n\n## Quick commands\n\n```bash\n# Verify flat layout (no nested SKILL.md)\nfor dir in skills/*/*/; do [[ -f \"${dir}SKILL.md\" ]] && echo \"NESTED: $dir\"; done\n\n# Verify skill count preserved\nfind skills -name SKILL.md -maxdepth 2 | wc -l  # should be 131\n\n# Verify plugin.json paths resolve\njq -r '.skills[]' .claude-plugin/plugin.json | while read p; do [[ -f \"${p}/SKILL.md\" ]] || echo \"MISSING: $p\"; done\n\n# Run validators\n./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh\n```\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] All 131 skills exist at `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (flat, one level deep)\n- [ ] No `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` paths remain (no nested skills)\n- [ ] `plugin.json` skill paths all resolve to existing directories with SKILL.md\n- [ ] All 131 SKILL.md files have `license:` field and unquoted descriptions\n- [ ] `./scripts/validate-skills.sh && ./scripts/validate-marketplace.sh` pass\n- [ ] `dotnet-advisor` contains compressed catalog visible within Copilot's 32-skill window\n- [ ] AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md, README.md updated for flat layout\n- [ ] Git history preserved for all moved files (git mv, not delete+create)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Builds on fn-42 (directory structure), fn-51 (frontmatter), fn-54 (test harness), fn-55 (validator)\n- All predecessors are done/merged; no open blockers\n- Epic fn-57 (testing) depends on this epic completing first\n\n## References\n\n- VS Code Copilot Chat: `src/platform/customInstructions/common/customInstructionsService.ts`\n- Agent Skills spec: https://agentskills.io/specification\n- Copilot CLI: https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/\n- Issue #48: https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/dotnet-skills/issues/48\n- dotnet-skills-evals: https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/dotnet-skills-evals\n- microsoft/skills: https://github.com/microsoft/skills (flat layout reference)\n"

Update all path references that depend on the nested layout.\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** skills/ (131 directories moved), .claude-plugin/plugin.json (132 path entries), test.sh (find depth), .agents/openai.yaml (default_prompt path pattern)\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Write a shell script that iterates all `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/` directories and runs `git mv` for each to `skills/<skill-name>/` \u2014 preserves git history\n2. Update all 132 entries in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `skills` array from `./skills/<category>/<skill-name>` to `./skills/<skill-name>`\n3.

Address known Copilot CLI YAML parsing bugs that cause silent skill load failures.\n\n**Size:** M\n**Files:** skills/*/SKILL.md (131 files), scripts/_validate_skills.py (ALLOWED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS)\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Add `license: MIT` field** to all 131 SKILL.md files \u2014 Copilot bug #894 effectively requires this field. Add after `description:` and before any optional fields.\n2. **Unquote description values** \u2014 Copilot bug #1024 breaks on `description: \"quoted text\"`. Remove surrounding double quotes from all description values. Verify no description starts with YAML special characters (`{`, `[`, `*`, `&`, `!`, `%`, `@`, `` ` ``) after unquoting.\n3. **Audit `metadata:` field position** \u2014 Copilot bug #951 breaks if `metadata:` is the last frontmatter field. No current skills have this, but add a validator check to prevent regression.\n4. **Add `license` to `ALLOWED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS`** in `_validate_skills.py:L58-65`.\n5. **Check for UTF-8 BOM** \u2014 Copilot bug #958 breaks if SKILL.md starts with BOM. Verify none exist; add validator check.\n6. Write a migration script (temporary, not committed) that processes all 131 files.\n\n## Key context\n\n- All 131 skills currently use `description: \"...\"` (double-quoted). Research confirms Copilot CLI #1024 fails on quoted descriptions.\n- 12+ descriptions contain colons (e.g., `OWASP Top 10: injection`). After unquoting, these are still valid YAML because the colon appears within a value context, not at the mapping level.\n- `_validate_skills.py:L58-65` has `ALLOWED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS = {\"name\", \"description\", \"user-invocable\", \"disable-model-invocation\", \"context\", \"model\"}`. Must add `\"license\"`.\n- The `EXTRA_FIELD_COUNT` baseline in `routing-warnings-baseline.json` will NOT be affected because `license` will be in the allowed set.\n- Single-quoted description exists for `dotnet-gha-patterns` \u2014 also needs unquoting.\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] All 131 SKILL.md files contain `license: MIT` in frontmatter\n- [ ] No SKILL.md file has double-quoted or single-quoted `description:` value\n- [ ] No SKILL.md file starts with UTF-8 BOM\n- [ ] No SKILL.md file has `metadata:` as the last frontmatter field\n- [ ] `license` added to `ALLOWED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` in `_validate_skills.py`\n- [ ] `./scripts/validate-skills.sh` passes after changes\n- [ ] Spot-check 5 descriptions containing colons parse correctly with both Python yaml and Copilot CLI\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"

Add a new check: **flat layout guard** that warns if any SKILL.md is found more than 1 level deep under `skills/` (catches accidental re-nesting).\n3. **`_validate_skills.py`**: Add frontmatter safety checks for Copilot compatibility:\n   - Warn if `description:` value is quoted\n   - Warn if `metadata:` is the last frontmatter field\n   - Warn if file starts with UTF-8 BOM\n   - Warn if `license:` is missing\n4. **`validate-similarity.py`**: Check if it keys on category paths.

Verify this after flatten.\n\n2. **Optimize advisor description for Copilot activation.** Current description routes .NET work generically. For Copilot, the description must clearly signal that it covers ALL .NET development topics \u2014 making it the primary entry point.\n\n3. **Update advisor compressed catalog.** The advisor already contains a compressed skill catalog with `[skill:name]` cross-references. Ensure this catalog:\n   - Lists all 130 skills organized by domain (not alphabetically \u2014 by capability)\n   - Uses strong activation language per Copilot best practice (#978)\n   - Is optimized for the Level 2 \u2192 Level 3 progressive disclosure model (advisor body loaded \u2192 references load specific skills on demand)\n\n4. **Prioritize the top 32 visible skills.** Analyze which 32 skills (alphabetically first `dotnet-*`) are in the visible window. Identify any high-value skills that fall outside the window. Options:\n   - If critical skills are outside top 32: consider strategic renames (e.g., prefix with `a-dotnet-*` or create alias skills)\n   - If the top 32 naturally cover the highest-value domains: no renames needed \u2014 document the prioritization\n\n5. **Document the 32-skill constraint** in CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md so future skill authors understand the naming implications.\n\n## Key context\n\n- dotnet-skills-evals tested a \"compressed index\" discovery mechanism and found 56.5% TPR with Sonnet \u2014 this is the advisor's approach\n- The advisor at `skills/foundation/dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md` (after flatten: `skills/dotnet-advisor/SKILL.md`) currently has 360 lines with 221 `[skill:]` cross-references\n- Copilot's progressive disclosure: Level 1 (name+description) \u2192 Level 2 (SKILL.md body) \u2192 Level 3 (referenced skills)\n- The model can only invoke skills it has seen metadata for at Level 1, OR skills referenced within an already-loaded skill's body at Level 2\n- Copilot issue #978: \"Skills not auto-activated\" \u2014 strong activation language in descriptions is essential\n## Acceptance\n- [ ] `dotnet-advisor` verified within Copilot's 32-skill visible window after flatten\n- [ ] Advisor description optimized for Copilot activation (strong trigger language, covers all .NET domains)\n- [ ] Advisor compressed catalog updated with all 130 skills, organized by capability domain\n- [ ] Top 32 alphabetically-first skills documented with their domains\n- [ ] Any critical-but-invisible skills addressed (rename, alias, or documented as advisor-routed only)\n- [ ] 32-skill constraint documented in CONTRIBUTING-SKILLS.md\n- [ ] Advisor `[skill:]` cross-references all resolve correctly\n## Done summary\nTBD\n\n## Evidence\n- Commits:\n- Tests:\n- PRs:\n"
