test_prompts:
  - "Set up a Blazor Web App with InteractiveAuto render mode. The home page should be Static SSR for SEO, the dashboard should use streaming rendering for slow data, and a real-time counter component should be interactive. Show proper render mode boundaries and PersistentComponentState usage."
  - "I need to choose the right Blazor hosting model for a Line-of-Business app with 200 concurrent users, offline requirements for some features, and SEO for public-facing pages. Compare the options and show the project setup."

criteria:
  - name: render_mode_selection
    weight: 0.30
    description: "Correctly differentiates between Static SSR (default, no interactivity), InteractiveServer (SignalR circuit), InteractiveWebAssembly (browser runtime), and InteractiveAuto (Server first, then WASM). Sets render modes at appropriate granularity (global in App.razor, per-page, or per-component). Does not default to InteractiveServer for every page."
  - name: streaming_and_prerendering
    weight: 0.25
    description: "Uses [StreamRendering] attribute for pages with slow data sources to send initial HTML immediately. Implements PersistentComponentState to preserve data across the prerender-to-interactive transition, avoiding double data fetching and visible flicker."
  - name: project_structure
    weight: 0.20
    description: "Places WASM-targeted components in the .Client project, not the server project. Understands Blazor Web App project structure with Components/Pages in server project and Client/Pages for browser-side components. Configures render mode boundaries correctly (child cannot request more interactive mode than parent without explicit boundary)."
  - name: routing_and_navigation
    weight: 0.15
    description: "Uses @page directives with route constraints ({Id:int}). Applies [SupplyParameterFromQuery] for query string parameters. Uses NavigationManager for programmatic navigation. Understands enhanced navigation intercepts link clicks for DOM patching and when to opt out with data-enhance-nav=false."
  - name: aot_safe_patterns
    weight: 0.10
    description: "Uses source-generated JsonSerializerContext for JSON serialization in WASM. Registers context via ConfigureHttpJsonOptions with TypeInfoResolverChain. Avoids reflection-based patterns (Activator.CreateInstance, Assembly.GetTypes) that fail under AOT/trimming."
