test_prompts:
  - "Write xUnit tests for a .NET service that processes customer orders, including tests for successful order creation, validation failures, and async operations. The service has methods CreateAsync, CancelAsync, and GetByIdAsync."
  - "How do I share an expensive database fixture across multiple xUnit test classes while keeping tests isolated? Show the fixture, collection definition, and test class setup."

criteria:
  - name: xunit_v3_conventions
    weight: 0.25
    description: "Uses xUnit v3 conventions correctly: [Fact] for single cases, [Theory] with [InlineData]/[MemberData]/[ClassData] for parameterized tests, TheoryData<T> or TheoryDataRow<T> for strongly-typed data, and ValueTask return types for IAsyncLifetime."
  - name: fixture_and_lifecycle
    weight: 0.25
    description: "Applies IClassFixture<T> for per-class shared resources and ICollectionFixture<T> with [CollectionDefinition] and [Collection] for cross-class sharing. Uses IAsyncLifetime for async setup/teardown instead of constructors and IDisposable."
  - name: assertion_quality
    weight: 0.20
    description: "Uses appropriate xUnit assertions (Assert.Equal, Assert.Throws, Assert.ThrowsAsync, Assert.NotNull, Assert.Single) rather than boolean Assert.True for value comparisons. Uses Assert.Multiple for grouped assertions (v3). Avoids assertion messages (removed in v3)."
  - name: test_structure
    weight: 0.15
    description: "Follows Arrange/Act/Assert pattern with clear section separation. One logical concept per [Fact]. Descriptive test method names following Method_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior convention. Async test methods return Task or ValueTask, never async void."
  - name: parallelism_awareness
    weight: 0.15
    description: "Demonstrates understanding of xUnit parallel execution: tests sharing mutable state are grouped in named collections with [CollectionDefinition] and DisableParallelization where needed, rather than disabling parallelism globally. Mentions xunit.runner.json for assembly-level configuration."
