# Rubric Contract Documentation
#
# This file documents the required structure for rubric YAML files in rubrics/.
# It is NOT a formal JSON Schema -- validation is performed by validate_rubrics.py
# using custom Python checks (no jsonschema dependency).
#
# Each rubric file must be named <skill_name>.yaml and placed in rubrics/.

# Required top-level fields:
#
# skill_name: string
#   Must match the filename (without .yaml extension).
#   Must correspond to a valid skill directory under skills/.
#
# test_prompts: array of strings
#   Minimum 1 entry. Each entry is a user prompt that exercises the skill.
#   Used by effectiveness (L5) and size impact (L6) runners.
#
# criteria: array of objects
#   Each criterion defines a scoring dimension for the LLM judge.
#   Required fields per criterion:
#     name: string (non-empty)
#     weight: float (0.0 < weight <= 1.0)
#     description: string (non-empty, explains what the judge should evaluate)
#
# Constraints:
#   - Sum of all criteria weights must equal 1.0 (tolerance +/- 0.01)
#   - At least one criterion is required
#   - No duplicate criterion names within a rubric

# Example rubric:
#
# skill_name: dotnet-xunit
# test_prompts:
#   - "Write xUnit tests for a calculator class with Add and Subtract methods"
#   - "How do I use Theory and InlineData in xUnit?"
# criteria:
#   - name: correctness
#     weight: 0.4
#     description: "Code compiles, tests follow xUnit conventions, assertions are valid"
#   - name: completeness
#     weight: 0.3
#     description: "Covers positive, negative, and edge cases"
#   - name: best_practices
#     weight: 0.3
#     description: "Uses Arrange/Act/Assert, descriptive names, proper fixtures"
